- Firedancer is a node implementation written in C for the solana blockchain. It will be the second full node implementation of Solana with the comping up Light Client Tinydancer. Firedancer will diversify the client stack and make the network more resilient as if there is an bug in the original rust node that halts the validators from producing blocks and coming to a consensus, validators running FD will keep the network secure and stable.

- # Why C?
	- When Building something like Firedancer which could potentially be run on thousands of machines, the code has to be efficient. C allows were tight integration with the hardware and make it allow developers a lot of flexibility in the ability to manage compute resources. Here Josh Siegel one of the core builders of Firedancer explain in depth and practical demo on "why C"?
