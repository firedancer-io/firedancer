# CodeQL queries for Firedancer

This directory contains CodeQL queries and tests that are specific to the Firedancer codebase.

The queries are split into `dev` and `nightly` directories. The `dev` queries can be manually run, while the `nightly` queries are run once a day on the `main` branch.

The `test` directory contains tests for the queries.
