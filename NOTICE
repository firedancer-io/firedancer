fd_hash and fd_hash_memcpy are currently a modified implementation of
the hashing algorithm in xxHash(r39).  xxHash(r39) can be found at
https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash/releases/tag/r39 (note the xxHash
source code repository has changed location a few times over the years).

fd_uint_hash and fd_ulong_hash are currently based on the final full
avalanche integer mixing functions, fmix32 and fmix64, found in the
MurmurHash3 hashing algorithm.  Murmur3 can be found at
https://github.com/aappleby/smhasher.

The sha512 implementation in src/ballet/sha512 is currently a modified
implementation of the OpenSSL sha512 implementation circa 2022-Oct.

The assembly language file in src/ballet/sha512/fd_sha512_core_avx2.S
contains autogenerated assembly code produced by OpenSSL's sha512 AVX2
asm code generator.  From crypto/sha/asm/sha512-x86_64.pl#L2:

Similarly the sha256 implementation in src/ballet/sha256 is based on the
OpenSSL sha256 implementation and the assembly language file
src/ballet/sha256/fd_sha256_core_shaext.S contains autogenerated
assembly code produced by OpenSSL's sha256 SHA extension assembly
generator.  The corresponding license terms are the same as sha512 and
can be found at crypto/sha/sha256.c#L1, crypto/sha/asm/sha256-586.pl#L2
and crypto/perlasm/x86asm.pl#L2 (all circa 2022-Dec).

Further description of the modifications can be found in the
implementations themselves.
