fd_hash and fd_hash_memcpy are currently a modified implementation of
the hashing algorithm in xxHash(r39).  xxHash(r39) can be found at
https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash/releases/tag/r39 (note the xxHash
source code repository has changed location a few times over the years).

fd_uint_hash and fd_ulong_hash are currently based on the final full
avalanche integer mixing functions, fmix32 and fmix64, found in the
MurmurHash3 hashing algorithm.  Murmur3 can be found at
https://github.com/aappleby/smhasher.

The sha512 implementation in src/ballet/sha512 is currently a modified
implementation of the OpenSSL sha512 implementation circa 2022-Oct.

Similarly the sha256 implementation in src/ballet/sha256 is based on the
OpenSSL sha256 implementation and the assembly language file
src/ballet/sha256/fd_sha256_core_shaext.S contains autogenerated
assembly code produced by OpenSSL's sha256 SHA extension assembly
generator.  The corresponding license terms are the same as sha512 and
can be found at crypto/sha/sha256.c#L1, crypto/sha/asm/sha256-586.pl#L2
and crypto/perlasm/x86asm.pl#L2 (all circa 2022-Dec).

Further description of the modifications can be found in the
implementations themselves.

The AES-ECB and AES-GCM implementations in src/ballet/aes were adapted
from the OpenSSL project (ca 2023-Aug).

The following OpenSSL C sources were partially copied and heavily
modified/simplified to fit the Firedancer code style:
- include/crypto/aes_platform.h
- crypto/evp/e_aes.c
- crypto/modes/gcm128.c
- providers/implementations/ciphers/ciphercommon_gcm.c
- providers/implementations/ciphers/ciphercommon_gcm_hw.c

Resulting in the following Firedancer C sources:
- src/ballet/aes/fd_aes.h
- src/ballet/aes/fd_aes_private.h
- src/ballet/aes/fd_aes_gcm.h
- src/ballet/aes/fd_aes_gcm_private.h
- src/ballet/aes/fd_aes_ref.c
- src/ballet/aes/fd_aes.c
- src/ballet/aes/fd_ghash_ref.c

The following OpenSSL code generators were used to produce autogenerated
assembly code.
- crypto/aes/asm/aesni-x86_64.pl
- crypto/modes/asm/aesni-gcm-x86_64.pl
- crypto/modes/asm/ghash-x86_64.pl

Resulting in the following Firedancer assembly code:
- src/ballet/aes/fd_aesni.S
- src/ballet/aes/fd_aesni_gcm.S
- src/ballet/aes/fd_ghash_avx.S

Further description of the modifications can be found in the
implementations themselves.
