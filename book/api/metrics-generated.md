## All Tiles
<!--@include: ./metrics-tile-preamble.md-->
| Metric | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| tile_&#8203;pid | `gauge` | The process ID of the tile. |
| tile_&#8203;tid | `gauge` | The thread ID of the tile. Always the same as the Pid in production, but might be different in development. |
| stem_&#8203;in_&#8203;backpressure | `gauge` | Whether the tile is currently backpressured or not, either 1 or 0. |
| stem_&#8203;backpressure_&#8203;count | `counter` | Number of times the times the tile has had to wait for one of more consumers to catch up to resume publishing. |
| stem_&#8203;loop_&#8203;housekeeping_&#8203;duration_&#8203;seconds | `histogram` | Duration of one iteration of the run loop which did housekeeping. The various loop durations are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, so the sum of time across all of them is roughly the total running time of the tile. Loop durations are per iteration of the run loop and non-blocking, so for example each 'caught up' sample does not represent the time we waited for new input data, but rather how long each iteration of the spin loop waiting for the data took. |

| stem_&#8203;loop_&#8203;caught_&#8203;up_&#8203;duration_&#8203;seconds | `histogram` | Duration of one iteration of the run loop which terminated because there was no new data to process. |
| stem_&#8203;loop_&#8203;overrun_&#8203;polling_&#8203;duration_&#8203;seconds | `histogram` | Duration of one iteration of the run loop which terminated because we were overrun while polling. |
| stem_&#8203;loop_&#8203;overrun_&#8203;reading_&#8203;duration_&#8203;seconds | `histogram` | Duration of one iteration of the run loop which terminated because we were overrun while reading. |
| stem_&#8203;loop_&#8203;filter_&#8203;before_&#8203;fragment_&#8203;duration_&#8203;seconds | `histogram` | Duration of one iteration of the run loop which terminated because we filtered the fragment before reading it. |
| stem_&#8203;loop_&#8203;filter_&#8203;after_&#8203;fragment_&#8203;duration_&#8203;seconds | `histogram` | Duration of one iteration of the run loop which terminated because we filtered the fragment after reading it. |
| stem_&#8203;loop_&#8203;finish_&#8203;duration_&#8203;seconds | `histogram` | Duration of one iteration of the run loop which received, did not filter, and processed the fragment. |
| stem_&#8203;fragment_&#8203;filtered_&#8203;size_&#8203;bytes | `histogram` | Size of each fragment that was filtered and not processed by the tile. |
| stem_&#8203;fragment_&#8203;handled_&#8203;size_&#8203;bytes | `histogram` | Size of each fragment that was processed (not filtered) by the tile. |
