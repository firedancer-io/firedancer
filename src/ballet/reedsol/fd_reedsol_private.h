/* fd_reedsol_private_recover_var_{n}: Verifies the consistency
   of the Reed-Solomon encoded data, and recovers any missing data.
   At least data_shred_cnt of the first n shreds must be un-erased,
   which implies data_shred_cnt <= n.

   Unlike the encode operations, the math doesn't care much whether a
   shred is a data shred or parity shred for recover operations, hence
   the function only has one shred array.  The parity shreds come
   immediately after the data shreds.

   For each value of i in [0, data_shred_cnt+parity_shred_cnt), erased[
   i ] must be 0 (if shred[ i ] contains valid data) or 1 if shred[ i ]
   is an erasure (i.e. wasn't received, was corrupted, etc.).  If
   erased[ i ]==1, the contents of shred[ i ] are ignored on entry, and
   upon return, shred[ i ][ j ] will be overwritten with the correct
   data for j in [0, shred_sz).

   Note that since data_shred_cnt+parity_shred_cnt<=134, shred[ i ] and
   erased[ i ] for i>=134 are completely ignored.

   Returns one of:

   FD_REEDSOL_SUCCESS if okay

   FD_REEDSOL_ERR_CORRUPT if the shreds are not consistent with having
   come from a Reed-Solomon encoding of data_shred_cnt data shreds

   FD_REEDSOL_ERR_PARTIAL if there's not enough un-erased data to
   recover data_shred_cnt data shreds

   TODO: Add a recover_private_first_{n} variant that imposes the
   additional constraint that the first data_shred_cnt shreds must be
   un-erased, is the case when no packets have been lost.  Would be
   slightly faster. */
