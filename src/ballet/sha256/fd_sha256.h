   There are _no_ alignment restrictions on data and hash and _no_
   restrictions on sz.  After a message is added, that message should
   not be changed or deleted until the fini or abort is called on the
   in-progress calculation.  Likewise, the hash memory region shot not
   be read, written or deleted until the calculation has completed.

   Messages can overlap and/or be added to a batch multiple times.  Each
   hash location added to a batch should not overlap any other hash
   location of calculation state or message region.  (Hash reuse /
   overlap have indeterminiant but non-crashing behavior as the
   implementation under the hood is free to execute the elements of the
   batch in whatever order it sees fit and potentially do those
   calculations incrementally / in the background / ... as the batch is
   assembled.)

   Depending on the implementation, it might help performance to cluster
   adds of similar sized messages together.  Likewise, it can be
   advantageous to use aligned message regions, aligned hash regions and
   messages sizes that are a multiple of a SHA block size.  None of this
   is required though.
