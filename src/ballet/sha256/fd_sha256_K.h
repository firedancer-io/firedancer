/* This stores the round constants, typically called K.  It's the first
   32 bits of the fractional parts of the cube roots of the first 64
   primes.

   We store it in text as a macro, not in binary, so that the compiler's
   constant propagation can use the values.  If we stored it in binary
   and used FD_IMPORT_BIN, only the linker knows about the values.
   Turns out, the assembler is fine with the U suffix for the numbers as
   well.  The assembler is a bit more sensitive and requires that there
   not be whitespace after the commas.

   No include guard is needed, since this just defines a macro. */
