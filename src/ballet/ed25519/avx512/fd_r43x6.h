/* A fd_r43x6_t represents a GF(p) element, where p = 2^255-19, in a
   little endian 6 long radix 2^43 limb representation.  The 6 limbs are
   held in lanes 0 through 5 of an AVX-512 vector.  That is, given a
   fd_r43x6_t x, the field element represented by x is:

     ( x0 + x1 2^43 + x2 2^86 + x3 2^129 + x4 2^172 + x5 2^215 ) mod p

   where xn is the n-th 64-bit vector lane treated as a long.  Lanes 6
   and 7 are ignored.  The below will often use the shorthand:

     <x0,x1,x2,x3,x4,x5>

   for the above expression.

   This representation is redundant: multiple fd_r43x6_t can represent
   the same element.  Most functions have restrictions on the which
   representations can be used for inputs and which representations they
   produce to support high performance implementation and composability.

   Frequently used representations are:

   - arbitrary:      limbs     are in [-2^63,2^63)
   - signed:         limbs     are in [-2^62,2^62)
   - unsigned:       limbs     are in [0,2^62)
   - unreduced:      limbs     are in [0,2^47)
   - unpacked:       limbs 0-4 are in [0,2^43), limb 5 is in [0,2^41)
   - nearly reduced: limbs 0-4 are in [0,2^43), limb 5 is in [0,2^41), the packed uint256 value is in [0,2*p)
   - reduced:        limbs 0-4 are in [0,2^43), limb 5 is in [0,2^40), the packed uint256 value is in [0,p)

   As a frequently used shorthand when analyzing range of limbs, unn
   indicates limbs are in [0,2^nn) and snn indicates limbs are in
   (-2^nn,2^nn).

   Note:

   - There is only one reduced fd_r43x6_t for each element.

   - There are two nearly reduced fd_r43x6_t for each element.

   - reduced is a subset of nearly reduced is a subset of unpacked is a
     subset of unreduced is a subset of unsigned is a subset of signed
     is a subset arbitrary.

   - unpacked, nearly reduced and reduced fd_r43x6_t be quickly
     converted into a packed uint256 value used by various cryptographic
     protocols and vice versa.

   - Cheat sheat

       unpack maps uint256 to unpacked
       pack   maps unpacked to uint256

       * These are used to interface with external protocols.

       fold_unsigned maps unsigned to unreduced
       fold_signed   maps   signed to unreduced

       * fold_* are fast and typically used to keep the ranges of limbs
         reasonable in long running calculations without needing to do
         more expensive approx_mod_* or mod_* operations.

       approx_mod_unreduced maps unreduced to nearly reduced
       approx_mod_unpacked  maps unpacked  to nearly reduced

       * approx_mod_* are typically used to get inputs to a long running
         calculation into a suitable form or by mod_* below.

       mod                maps arbitrary      to reduced (equiv to approx_mod           / mod_nearly_reduced)
       mod_signed         maps signed         to reduced (equiv to approx_mod_signed    / mod_nearly_reduced)
       mod_unsigned       maps unsigned       to reduced (equiv to approx_mod_unsigned  / mod_nearly_reduced)
       mod_unreduced      maps unreduced      to reduced (equiv to approx_mod_unreduced / mod_nearly_reduced)
       mod_unpacked       maps unpacked       to reduced (equiv to approx_mod_unpacked  / mod_nearly_reduced)
       mod_nearly_reduced maps nearly reduced to reduced

       * mod_* are typically used for produce a final unique result at
         the end of a long running calculation.

     y1-y4 in [0,2^43+   (2^20-1))

   Theory:

     x = <x0,x1,x2,x3,x4,x5>
       = <x0l,x1l,x2l,x3l,x4l,x5l> + <2^43*x0h,2^43*x1h,2^43*x2h,2^43*x3h,2^43*x4h,2^40*x5h>
       = <x0l,x1l,x2l,x3l,x4l,x5l> + <19*x5h,x0h,x1h,x2h,x3h,x4h>

   where x0h=floor(x0/2^43) and x0l = x0-2^43*x0h and similarly for
   x1-x4 while x5h = floor(x5/2^40) and x5l=x5-2^40*x5h.

   Above we used:

     2^215*2^40*x5h = 2^255*x5h = (p+19)*x5h mod p = 19*x5h mod p.

   Equivalently, x0l-x5l are the least significant {43,43,43,43,43,40}
   bits of x0-x5 and x0h-x5l are the sign extending right shifts of
   x0-x5 by the same.

   For arbitrary x we have:

     x0l-x4l in [0,2^43), x0h-x4h in [-2^20,2^20)
     x5l     in [0,2^40), x5h     in [-2^23,2^23)

   while for x0-x5 in [0,2^63) (which includes unsigned) we have:

     x0l-x4l in [0,2^43), x0h-x4h in [0,2^20)
     x5l     in [0,2^40), x5h     in [0,2^23)

   This yields the above ranges for y0-y5.  There are no intermediate
   overflows in the computation.

   This is a building block for more complex mappings where x's limbs
   have already been extracted in order to minimize the number of limb
   extracts and fd_r43x6 constructs.

   Note that if we used ulongs (and thus zero padding right shifts)
   below, this same style calculation could be used on an arbitrary
   _ulong_ limbed x.  The result would still be an unreduced fd_r43x6_t
   with:

/* fd_r43x6_approx_carry_propagate is a vectorized version of the above.
   Returned lanes 6 and 7 are zero.  If we've already extracted x's
   limbs and/or need the resulting limbs after, it is usually faster to
   do the extract and then use the scalar implementation.

   The fold_unsigned variant is the same but assumes x is unsigned or
   more generally x0-x5 in [0,2^63).  This allows a faster madd52lo to
   be used instead of a slower mullo.  (Hat tip to Philip Taffet for
   pointing this out.) It will also work for an arbitrary limbed ulong
   x.

   The fold_signed variant assumes x is signed or more generally:

     x0    in [-2^63+19*2^23,2^63)
     x1-x5 in [-2^63   +2^20,2^63)

   and subtracts x by <19*2^23,2^20,2^20,2^20,2^20,2^20> (which will not
   overflow) before the approx carry propagate and add it back after.
   This will not overflow and will not change the element represented.

/* fd_r43x6_biased_carry_propagate_limbs computes an equivalent
   fd_r43x6_t to a signed fd_r43x6_t that has been extracted into the
   longs x0-x5 and stores the result into the longs y0-y5.  x5 is
   subtracted by a small bias in [0,2^20] before that is added back
   after.  This has no impact on the element represented but can impact
   the range needed for limb 5.  In-place operation fine.  This macro is
   robust.

   IMPORTANT!  THIS SHOULD NOT BE APPLIED TO ARBITRARY X.

   If x is signed or more generally:

     x0    in [-2^63+19*2^23,2^63-19*(2^23-1))
     x1-x4 in [-2^63+   2^20,2^63-   (2^20-1))
     x5    in [-2^63+b,      2^63            )

   On return y will be signed but only in one limb such that it is
   almost nearly reduced:

     y0-y4 in [0,      2^43         )
     y5    in [-2^20+b,2^40+2^20-1+b)

   Thus, with b=2^20, if x is signed or more generally

     x0    in [-2^63+19*2^23,2^63-19*(2^23-1))
     x1-x4 in [-2^63+   2^20,2^63-   (2^20-1))
     x5    in [-2^63+   2^20,2^63            )

   On return y will be nearly reduced with y5 in [0,2^40+2^21-1).

   And, with b=0, if x is unsigned or more generally:

     x0    in [0,2^63-19*(2^23-1))
     x1-x4 in [0,2^63-   (2^20-1))
     x5    in [0,2^63            )

   On return y will be nearly reduced with y5 in [0,2^40+2^20-1).

   With b=0, the more restricted x is, the tighter the y5 range.  If x
   is {unreduced,unpacked,nearly reduced}, with b=0, on return, y will
   be nearly reduced with y5 in {[0,2^40+2^5-1),[0,2^40+1),[0,2^40+1)}.
   If x is reduced, on return, y will be reduced.

   Under the hood, this does a serial carry propagate on the limbs.

   Theory:

   Break an arbitrary x5 into its lower and upper bits as was done for
   approx_carry_propagate.  Then:

     x = <x0,x1,x2,x3,x4,x5l> + 2^40 <0,0,0,0,0,x5h>
       = <x0,x1,x2,x3,x4,x5l> + 19 <x5h,0,0,0,0,0>
       = <x0l+19*x5h,x1,x2,x3,x4,x5l>

   As x5h will be in [-2^23,2^23), if the initial x0 is in
   [-2^63+19*2^23,2^63-19*(2^23-1)), this new representation can be
   computed without intermediate overflow with limb 4 in [0,2^40) and
   limb 0 in [-2^63,2^63).

   Now break an arbitrary x0 into its lower and upper bits.  Then:

       x = <x0,x1,x2,x3,x4,x5>
         = <x0l,x1,x2,x3,x4,x5> + 2^43 <x0h,0,0,0,0,0>
         = <x0l,x1,x2,x3,x4,x5> + <0,x0h,0,0,0,0>
         = <x0l,x1+x0h,x2,x3,x5>

   As x0h will be in [-2^20,2^20), if the initial x1 is in
   [-2^63+2^20,2^63-(2^20-1)), this new representation can be computed
   without intermediate overflow with limb 0 in [0,2^43) and limb 1 in
   [-2^63,2^63).

   We can similarly serially propagate limb 1's carries to 2, 2 to 3, 3
   to 4 and 4 to 5.  As x4h will be in [-2^20,2^20), the limb 5's final
   value will be in [-2^20,2^40+2^20-1).

   If x is in unsigned or in the unsigned range described above, limb 4's
   carry will be in [0,2^20) such that the result will be nearly reduced
   with limb 5 in [0,2^40+2^20-1).

   If x is {unreduced,unpacked,nearly reduced}, limb 4's carry will be
   in {[0,2^5),[0,1],[0,1]} such that limb 5 will be be in
   {[0,2^40+2^5-1),[0,2^40+1),[0,2^40+1)}.

   If x was reduced, all carries will be zero such that y will have the
   same limbs as x.

   This yields the above.

   Like approx_carry_propagate, this is a building block for more
   complex mappings where x's limbs have already been extracted in order
   to minimize the number of limb extracts and fd_r43x6 constructs. */

   fine.  This macro is robust.  Theory:

   Let x = q p + r where q is an integer and r is in [0,p).  Since x is
   in [0,2*p), q is in [0,1].  If x<p, q=0 and r=x, otherwise, q=1 and
   r=x-p.  Using p = 2^255 - 19, x<p implies x+19<2^255.  Thus, if x+19
   has bit 255 (limb 5 bit 40) clear, r=x, otherwise, r=x-p.

   In pseudo code:
     y = x + 19                ... < 2*p+19 = 2^256-19 < 2^256
     q = y>>255                ... in [0,1]

   Simplifying:
     y = x + 19
     q = y>>255
     if !q, r = y - 19
     else   r = y - 2^255

     y -= q<<255       ... clear bit 255

     else   r = y

   Or, branchless for deterministic performance:

     q  = y>>255
     y -= q<<255
     r  = y - if(!q,19,0) */

    The conventional split would require xi and xj to be in [0,2^43) and
    yield pijl and pijh in [0,2^43).  But we need to use a different
    split to exploit the madd52 instructions:

      ul = madd52lo(al,x,y) = LO64( al + LO52( LO52(x)*LO52(y) ) )
      uh = madd52hi(ah,x,y) = LO64( ah + HI52( LO52(x)*LO52(y) ) )

    Consider when al and ah are zero.  Since x and y here are unreduced
    and thus in [0,2^47), we have:

      ul = LO52( x*y )
      uh = HI52( x*y )
      --> ul + 2^52 uh       = x*y
      --> ul + 2^43 (2^9 uh) = x*y

    Thus, we can use pl=ul and and ph=2^9 uh from these instructions as
    a split for the above.  With this we have:

      pl in [0,2^52)
      ph in [0,2^51)

    so:

      z{0,1,2,3, 4, 5} < { 2, 5, 8,11,14,17} 2^51
      z{6,7,8,9,10,11} < {16,13,10, 7, 4, 1} 2^51

    Note: the [0,2^47) range for unreduced fd_r43x6_t was picked to
    yield pl and ph with similar ranges while allowing for fast
    reduction below.

    Note: It might seem even better to use a 5 long radix 52 limb
    representation such that madd naturally produces the desired
    splitting.  If the only consideration is the above, this is correct.

    But this calculation is frequently used in long sequential chains
    (e.g. the repeated squarings done to compute the multiplicative
    inverse).  In the 52x5 case, the zk reduction required to produce an
    output representation that can be fed into the next multiplication
    has no "headroom".  All carries from limbs 0-3 must be fully
    propagated to limb 4 such that all limbs are in [0,2^52) to be able
    to use madd52 subsequent multiply operations.  This requires then
    extracting all the limbs and doing a slow sequential calculation as
    part of the zk reduction.  This throws away most of the advantage of
    using instructions like madd52 in the first place.

    Using 43x6 is nearly the same cost as 52x5 for the above because we
    have unused AVX512 lanes and the scaling needed to tweak the
    madd52hi result is a fast shift operation.  Critically, the needed
    zk reduction (described below) can be done with a fast approximate
    carry propagate to get a result that can be immediately fed into
    subsequent multiplications.

    The overall impact is that this is typically ~2-3x faster than, for
    example, the fd_ed25519_fe_t scalar multiplier on platforms with
    AVX512 support.

    This implementation is not the "textbook" style found in the
    literature.  The textbook implementations accumulate zh and zl by
    interleaving alignr with the madds.  The putative benefit of such is
    that it can make use of the madd52hi adder to save some adds over
    the below.  Unfortunately, such requires more alignr / more
    instruction footprint / more sequential dependencies and has less
    ILP.  In practice, adds are much cheaper than alignr (remember, data
    motion has been more expensive than computation for decades).  So
    spending some adds to buy fewer alignr, a smaller instruction
    footprint and more ILP is a great trade and yields the faster than
    textbook implementation below. */
