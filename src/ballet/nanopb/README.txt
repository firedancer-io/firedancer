This directory contains a copy of the Nanopb library C source code.

This library is copied exactly from tag "nanopb-0.4.9.1", and there are
no Firedancer specific modifications to the code.  You should not make
local modifications to nanopb.  Instead prefer to upstream changes, or
make a local patch if needed.

Use `fetch.sh` and `nanopb_tag.txt` to update.
