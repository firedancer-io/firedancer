/* fd_sha512_{align,footprint} give the needed alignment and footprint
   of a memory region suitable to hold a sha512 calculation state.
   Declaration / aligned_alloc / fd_alloca friendly (e.g. a memory
   region declared as "fd_sha512_t _sha[1];", or created by
   "aligned_alloc(alignof(fd_sha512_t),sizeof(fd_sha512_t))" or created
   by "fd_alloca(alignof(fd_sha512_t),sizeof(fd_sha512_t))" will all
   automatically have the needed alignment and footprint).
   fd_sha512_{align,footprint} return the same value as
   FD_SHA512_{ALIGN,FOOTPRINT}.

   fd_sha512_new formats memory region with suitable alignment and
   footprint suitable for holding a sha512 calculation state.  Assumes
   shmem points on the caller to the first byte of the memory region
   owned by the caller to use.  Returns shmem on success and NULL on
   failure (logs details).  The memory region will be owned by the state
   on successful return.  The caller is not joined on return.

   fd_sha512_join joins the caller to a sha512 calculation state.
   Assumes shsha points to the first byte of the memory region holding
   the state.  Returns a local handle to the join on success (this is
   not necessarily a simple cast of the address) and NULL on failure
   (logs details).

   fd_sha512_leave leaves the caller's current local join to a sha512
   calculation state.  Returns a pointer to the memory region holding
   the state on success (this is not necessarily a simple cast of the
   address) and NULL on failure (logs details).  The caller is not
   joined on successful return.

   fd_sha512_delete unformats a memory region that holds a sha512
   calculation state.  Assumes shsha points on the caller to the first
   byte of the memory region holding the state and that nobody is
   joined.  Returns a pointer to the memory region on success and NULL
   on failure (logs details).  The caller has ownership of the memory
   region on successful return. */
