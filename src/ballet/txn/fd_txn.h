/* The main structure this header defines is fd_txn_t, which represents a
   Solana transaction.  A transaction, like a SQL database transaction, is the
   unit of execution atomicity in Solana, i.e. intermediate state is never
   visible to other transactions, and a failure at any point in the transaction
   causes the entire transaction to be rolled back (other than charging the
   transaction fee).

   A transaction primarily consists of a list of instructions to execute in
   sequence.  The struct fd_txn_instr_t describes one instruction.  An instruction
   specifies the invocation of a smart contract with some specified data and
   accounts.  The name 'instruction' was a poor choice, (since on-chain code is
   composed of eBPF instructions and using the same word to refer to very
   different concepts is confusing) but it's too late to change.  Thinking of a
   transaction-level instruction as a 'command' might be more useful.

   The other major component of a transaction is a list of account addresses.
   The address of any account that is referenced by any instruction in the
   transaction must appear in the list.  The address of any signer (including
   the fee payer) must appear in the list.  An account address is sometimes
   called a pubkey since it has the same format as one, though it is not always
   a public key strictly speaking (i.e. a corresponding private key may not
   exist).  Each account address in the list has associated permissions flags:
   signer/not signer and writable/readonly.  All 4 combinations are possible.
   These flags declare the transaction's intention in accessing the account,
   similar to the `mode` field of fopen( ). */

/* fd_txn_acct_iter_{init, next, end}: These functions are used for
   iterating over the accounts in a transaction that have the property
   specified by include_cat.

   Example usage:

   fd_txn_acct_addr const * acct = fd_txn_get_acct_addrs( txn, payload );
   fd_txn_acct_iter_t ctrl;
   for( ulong i=fd_txn_acct_iter_init( txn, FD_TXN_ACCT_CAT_WRITABLE, &ctrl );
         i<fd_txn_acct_iter_end(); i=fd_txn_acct_iter_next( i, &ctrl ) ) {
     // Do something with acct[ i ]
   }

   For fd_txn_acct_iter_init, txn must be a pointer to a valid
   transaction, include_cat must be one of the FD_TXN_ACCT_CAT_* values
   defined above (or a bitwise combination of them) and out_ctrl must
   point to a writable, potentially uninitialized fd_txn_acct_iter_t.
   Cannot fail from the caller's perspective.  On completion, returns
   the index of the first account address meeting the specified
   criteria, or fd_txn_acct_iter_end() if there aren't any.

   For fd_acct_iter_next, cur should be the current value of the
   iteration variable, and ctrl contains the control information
   produced by fd_txn_acct_iter_init, and potentially updated by calls
   to fd_acct_iter_next.  Returns the next value of the iteration
   variable, or fd_txn_acct_iter_end() if no more accounts meeting the
   criteria specified in the call to fd_txn_acct_iter_init remain.
   It is undefined behavior to call fd_acct_iter_next with values of cur
   and ctrl not returned by the same call to either fd_acct_iter_init or
   fd_acct_iter_next.  It's also U.B. to call fd_acct_iter_next after
   fd_acct_iter_end has been returned.

   fd_txn_acct_iter_t should be treated as an opaque handle and not
   modified other than by using fd_txn_acc_iter_next. It does not need
   to be destroyed, and is small enough that it should typically be
   allocated on the stack. */

typedef ulong fd_txn_acct_iter_t;

/* Account addresses are categorized into 6 categories, and all the
   account addresses for each category are stored contiguously.  This
   means that for any subset of the 6 categories that the user wants to
   iterate over, there are at most 3 disjoint ranges.

   For any iteration space I, we can choose 6 integers
   {start,end}_{0,1,2} so that
    I = [start0, end0) U [start1, end1) U [start2, end2)
   and 0<=start0<=end0<=start1<=end1<=start2<=end2<=256 with the
   additional restriction that the only empty interval we allow is
   [256, 256).
   The fact that we need to handle 0 and 256 is a bit pesky, because it
   seems like we need more than a byte to represent each number.
   However, notice that we return start0 from _init, so we don't need to
   represent it explicitly in the control word.  Furthermore, if
   start0==0, then all the remaining values are at least 1.  Thus, we
   can get away with storing each integer in one byte (an the whole
   control word in a single ulong) as long as we store one less than the
   actual value. */
