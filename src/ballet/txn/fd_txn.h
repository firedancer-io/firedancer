/* The main structure this header defines is fd_txn_t, which represents a
   Solana transaction.  A transaction, like a SQL database transaction, is the
   unit of execution atomicity in Solana, i.e. intermediate state is never
   visible to other transactions, and a failure at any point in the transaction
   causes the entire transaction to be rolled back (other than charging the
   transaction fee).

   A transaction primarily consists of a list of instructions to execute in
   sequence.  The struct fd_txn_instr_t describes one instruction.  An instruction
   specifies the invocation of a smart contract with some specified data and
   accounts.  The name 'instruction' was a poor choice, (since on-chain code is
   composed of eBPF instructions and using the same word to refer to very
   different concepts is confusing) but it's too late to change.  Thinking of a
   transaction-level instruction as a 'command' might be more useful.

   The other major component of a transaction is a list of account addresses.
   The address of any account that is referenced by any instruction in the
   transaction must appear in the list.  The address of any signer (including
   the fee payer) must appear in the list.  An account address is sometimes
   called a pubkey since it has the same format as one, though it is not always
   a public key strictly speaking (i.e. a corresponding private key may not
   exist).  Each account address in the list has associated permissions flags:
   signer/not signer and writable/readonly.  All 4 combinations are possible.
   These flags declare the transaction's intention in accessing the account,
   similar to the `mode` field of fopen( ). */

   -  signer/nonsigner: the sigverify tile ensures that the transaction

/* fd_txn_acct_iter_{init, next, end, idx}: These functions are used for
   iterating over the accounts in a transaction that have the property
   specified by include_cat.

   Example usage:

   fd_txn_acct_addr_t const * acct = fd_txn_get_acct_addrs( txn, payload );
   for( fd_txn_acct_iter_t i=fd_txn_acct_iter_init( txn, FD_TXN_ACCT_CAT_WRITABLE );
         i!=fd_txn_acct_iter_end(); i=fd_txn_acct_iter_next( i ) ) {
     // Do something with acct[ fd_txn_acct_iter_idx( i ) ]
   }

   For fd_txn_acct_iter_init, txn must be a pointer to a valid
   transaction and include_cat must be one of the FD_TXN_ACCT_CAT_*
   values defined above (or a bitwise combination of them).  On
   completion, returns a value i such that fd_txn_acct_iter_idx( i ) is
   the index of the first account address meeting the specified
   criteria, or i==fd_txn_acct_iter_end() if there aren't any account
   addresses that meet the criteria.

   For fd_acct_iter_next, cur should be the current value of the
   iteration variable.  Advances the iteration variable such that
   fd_txn_acct_iter_idx( i ) is the index of the next account meeting
   the initially specified criteria, or i==fd_txn_acct_iter_end() if
   there aren't any more account addresss meeting the criteria.  It is
   undefined behavior to call fd_acct_iter_next with a value of cur not
   returned by a call to either fd_acct_iter_init or fd_acct_iter_next.
   It's also U.B. to call fd_acct_iter_next after fd_acct_iter_end has
   been returned.

   fd_txn_acct_iter_t should be treated as an opaque handle and not
   modified other than by using fd_txn_acc_iter_next.  You can peek and
   see that it's a ulong, so it fits in a register and doesn't need to
   be destroyed or cleaned up.  It's safe to save a fd_txn_acct_iter_t
   value to resume iteration later with the same transaction. */

/* fd_txn_parse_core: Parses a transaction from the canonical encoding, i.e.
   the format used on the wire.

   Payload points to the first byte of encoded transaction, e.g. the
   first byte of the UDP/Quic payload if the transaction comes from the
   network.  The encoded transaction must occupy exactly [payload,
   payload+payload_sz), i.e. this method will read no more than
   payload_sz bytes from payload, but it will reject the transaction if
   it contains extra padding at the end or continues past
   payload+payload_sz.  payload_sz <= FD_TXN_MTU.

   out_buf is the memory where the parsed transaction will be stored.
   out_buf must have room for at least FD_TXN_MAX_SZ bytes.

   Returns the total size of the resulting fd_txn struct on success and
   0 on failure.  On failure, the contents of out_buf are undefined,
   although nothing will be written beyond FD_TXN_MAX_SZ bytes.

   If counters_opt is non-NULL, some some counters about the result of
   the parsing process will be accumulated into the struct pointed to by
   counters_opt. Note: The returned txn object is not self-contained
   since it refers to byte ranges inside the payload.

   payload_sz_opt, if supplied, gets filled with the total bytes this txn
   uses (allowing for walking of an entry/microblock). If it is not supplied, the
   parse will return an error if the payload_sz does not exactly match.

   allow_zero_signatures tells the parser we are ok with txn that have zero signatures.
   This is only used by the test engine to pass invalid transactions into the
   native programs.
