/* fd_blake3 provides APIs for BLAKE3 hashing of messages.

   The BLAKE3 specification is available here:
   https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3-specs/blob/master/blake3.pdf

   ### High-level overview

   fd_blake3 provides the "hash" mode of BLAKE3 with variable size
   output.  Keyed hashing and key derivation are not supported.  For
   hashes with more than 1024 bytes of input data, uses SIMD parallelism
   depending on hardware capabilities.  For smaller message sizes, use
   the batch API to process multiple independent inputs in parallel.

   ### Usage (simple)

     fd_blake3_t hasher[1];
     fd_blake3_init( hasher );
     fd_blake3_append( hasher, data, sz );
     uchar hash[ 32 ];
     fd_blake3_fini( hasher, hash );

   ### Usage (batched)

     ... TODO ...

   ### Hash Construction

   The "core" of BLAKE3 is an add-rotate-xor compression function with
   a 512-bit state size.  This state is created from the following
   896-bit input:

   - 256-bit chaining value (optionally used to create a hash chain)
   - 512-bit input data
   -  64-bit counter
   -  32-bit input data size
   -  32-bit flags

   The BLAKE3 hash is constructed purely by repeated invocation of the
   compression function while mixing in input data and metadata.

   At a high-level, there exist two phases: Compress, and expand.
   The data dependencies of the compression phase form a hash tree,
   ending in a 896-bit root input.  In the expand phase, the compression
   function is repeatedly applied on the root input with increasing
   counter values (each call producing 512-bit of final output data).

   The compress phase is further divided into the chunk phase and the
   tree phase.  In the chunk phase, each 8192-bit input is hashed to
   a 256-bit output via serial calls to the compression function.
   (Note that each chunk can be computed independently)

   In the tree phase, the chunks are joined pairwise into a hash tree.

   Figure 1 illustrates a BLAKE3 hash tree with a 2170 byte input
   (34 chunks in{X}), one branch nodes (b{Y}), the root state (RS), and
   a 192 byte hash output (h{Z}). */

/* ### Implementation

   fd_blake3 consists of three major parts:

     (1) Hash state machines, which track the progress of hash
         calculations and prepare operations to advance them;
     (2) Schedulers, which accumulate batches of operations from state
         machines, then send them to hash backends;
     (3) Hash backends (SSE, AVX2, AVX512) which work off a static size
         vector of independent hash operations.

   The goal is to maximize throughput.  The fastest backend usually is
   the widest, creating a scheduling problem.  The scheduler should be
   able to flexibly schedule operations in parallel without taking up
   valuable time that could be used for hashing.

   The simplest opportunity to parallelize is during chunk compression.
   The bulk of the work is done in the chunk phase, independently for
   each 1024 bytes of input data.  This is effective for inputs of size
   (width*FD_CHUNK_SZ), i.e. >=8192 bytes of input for AVX2.

   To accelerate processing of smaller inputs, a batch API is offered.
   Batching allows the scheduler to process operations over multiple
   independent messages at once. This has a significantly higher
   scheduling overhead though.

   It is worth noting that compression operations require a variable
   amount of compression function calls.  (Recall that each call
   processes 64 bytes of input data, but a chunk can have up to 1024
   bytes of data)  fd_blake3 therefore has an internal clock that ticks
   each time a hash backend processes a vector of blocks.  When a state
   machine schedules an op with a 1024 byte input, it knows that the op
   completes 16 ticks into the future. */
