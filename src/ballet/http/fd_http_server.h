   the caller to use.  Returns shmem on success and NULL on failure
   (logs details).  The memory region will be owned by the state on
   successful return.  The caller is not joined on return.

   fd_http_server_join joins the caller to a http server state. Assumes
   shhttp points to the first byte of the memory region holding the
   state.  Returns a local handle to the join on success (this is
   not necessarily a simple cast of the address) and NULL on failure
   (logs details).

   fd_http_server_leave leaves the caller's current local join to a http

   fd_http_server_delete unformats a memory region that holds a http
