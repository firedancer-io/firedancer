/* fd_toml_parse deserializes a TOML document and inserts the document's
   object tree into an fd_pod.  toml points to the first byte of the
   TOML.  toml_sz is the byte length of the TOML.  If toml_sz==0 then
   the toml pointer is ignored (may be invalid).  pod is a local join to
   an fd_pod_t.  [scratch,scratch+scratch_sz) is arbitrary unaligned
   scratch memory used during deserialization.  scratch_sz>=4kB
   recommended.  If scratch_sz is too small, may fail to deserialize
   long strings and sub tables.   On success, returns FD_POD_SUCCESS.
   On parse failure returns the line number at which the failure
   occurred (1-indexed). If the pod does not have enough space returns
   FD_TOML_ERR_OOM.  Note that toml is not interpreted as a cstr -- No
   terminating zero is fine and so are stray zeros in the middle of the
   file.

   fd_toml_parse is not hardened against untrusted input. fd_toml_parse
   is not optimized for performance.

   Mapping:

    TOML type      | Example     | fd_pod type
    ---------------|-------------|--------------------------------------
     table         | [key]       | subpod
     array table   | [[key]]     | subpod (keys %d formatted cstrs)
     inline table  | x={a=1,b=2} | subpod
     inline array  | x=[1,2]     | subpod (keys %d formatted cstrs)
     bool          | true        | int
     integer       | -3          | long
     float         | 3e-3        | float
     string        | 'hello'     | cstr
     datetime      | 2022-08-16  | ulong (ns since unix epoch)

   Despite the name, TOML is neither "obvious" nor "minimal".  fd_toml
   thus only supports a subset of the 'spec' and ignores some horrors.
   Known errata:

   - fd_toml allows duplicate tables and arrays whereas TOML has various
     complicated rules that forbid such.  For example, the following
     is not allowed in toml:

       fruit = []
       [[fruit]]  # inline arrays are immutable

   - fd_toml allows mixing tables and arrays which is forbidden in TOML

       a = [1]
       a.b = 1

   - Missing validation for out-of-bounds Unicode escapes

   - Missing support for CRLF

   - Missing support for subtables of array tables.
     The following gets deserialized as {a={b={c={d="val0"}}}} instead
     of {a=[{b=[{c={d="val0"}}]}]}

       [[a]]
         [[a.b]]
           [a.b.c]
             d = "val0"

   - Missing support for dot-escapes.
     The tables ["a.b"] and [a.b] are the same in fd_toml.

   - Keys with embedded NUL characters are truncated whereas they are
     legal in TOML.

   - Infinite and NaN floats are rejected. */
