/* fd_base58_encode_{32, 64}: Interprets the supplied 32 or 64 bytes
   (respectively) as a large big-endian integer, and converts it to a
   nul-terminated base58 string of:

     32 to 44 characters, inclusive (not counting nul) for 32 B
     64 to 88 characters, inclusive (not counting nul) for 64 B

   Stores the output in the buffer pointed to by out.  If opt_len is
   non-NULL, *opt_len == strlen( out ) on return.  Returns out.  out is
   guaranteed to be nul teriminated on return.

   Out must have enough space for FD_BASE58_ENCODED_{32,64}_SZ
   characters, including the nul terminator.

   The 32 byte conversion is suitable for printing Solana account
   addresses, and the 64 byte conversion is suitable for printing Solana
   transaction signatures.  This is high performance (~100ns for 32B and
   ~200ns for 64B without AVX, and roughly twice as fast with AVX), but
   base58 is an inherently slow format and should not be used in any
   performance critical places except where absolutely necessary. */

   on entry.  Returns out on success and NULL if the input string is
   invalid in some way: illegal base58 character or decodes to something
   other than 32 or 64 bytes (respectively).  The contents of out are
   undefined on failure (i.e. out may be clobbered).

   A similar note to the above applies: these are high performance
