/* API for creating NUMA-aware and TLB-efficient workspaces used for
   complex inter-thread and inter-process shared memory communication
   patterns.  fd must be booted to use the APIs in this module.

   For example, startup scripts could reserve some memory on each NUMA
   node backed by huge and gigantic pages:

     sudo bin/fd_shmem_cfg alloc   8 gigantic 0 \
                           alloc   8 gigantic 1 \
                           alloc 256     huge 0 \
                           alloc 256     huge 1

   and then some of this memory could be formatted into fd_wksp for each
   NUMA node:

     bin/fd_shmem_ctl new my-wksp-numa-0 1 gigantic 0 \
                      new my-wksp-numa-1 1 gigantic 1

   Then, at application startup, processes can join these fd_wksp and
   concurrently allocate memory from the desired NUMA nodes as
   necessary.  E.g.

     fd_wksp_t * wksp = fd_wksp_attach( "my-wksp-numa-0" ); // logs details on failure
     if( !fd_wksp ) ... handle attach failure ...;

     ulong gaddr = fd_wksp_alloc( wksp, align, sz ); // logs details on failure
     if( !gaddr ) ... handle alloc failure ...;

   The local address of a workspace global address can be found via:

     void * laddr = fd_wksp_laddr( wksp, gaddr ); // logs details on failure
     if( !laddr ) ... handle bad (wksp,gaddr) ...;

   and the global address of a workspace local address can be found via:

     ulong gaddr = fd_wksp_gaddr( wksp, laddr ); // logs details on failure
     if( !gaddr ) ... handle bad (wksp,laddr) ...;

   Allocations can be freed via:

     fd_wksp_free( wksp, gaddr );

   Any join can free any allocation regardless of who made it.

   When the application is done using a wksp, it should leave it.  The
   workspace will continue to exist (it just is no longer safe to access
   in the caller's address space).  E.g.

     fd_wksp_detach( wksp ); // logs details on failure

   Likewise, if the workspaces are no longer in use, they can be deleted
   via something like:

     bin/fd_wksp_ctl delete my-wksp-numa-0 \
                     delete my-wksp-numa-1

   All allocations can be freed via something like:

     bin/fd_wksp_ctl reset my-wksp-numa-0 \
                     reset my-wksp-numa-1

   or in code:

     fd_wksp_reset( wksp, seed ); // logs details on failure

   It is the caller's responsibility to ensure that previous allocations
   to the wksp are not in use.

   Note: while this presents "aligned_alloc" style API semantics, this
   is not designed to be algorithmically optimal, HPC implementation or
   efficient at doing lots of tiny allocations.  Rather it is designed
   to be akin to an "mmap" / "sbrk" style allocator of last resort, done
   rarely and then ideally at application startup (e.g. setting up
   datastructures at box startup or used in an interprocess lockfree
   allocator as a mmap replacement).

   Instead, this tries to keep wksp fragmentation low with low overhead
   and tight packing of larger size allocations (normal page size and
   up).  It further tries to proactively limit the risk of heap
   _metadata_ corruption (proactive intraworkspace heap application
   _data_ corruption prevention is not a goal though typical mechanisms
   for such are in _direct_ opposition to efficient use of TLB, low
   fragmentation and tight allocation packing).  It is quasi-lockfree
   such that a process _killed_ in the middle of a workspace operation
   will not prevent other processes from using the workspace but a
   process _stalled_ in the middle of a workspace operations can stall
   other applications waiting to use the workspace indefinitely.
   Operators can track down an errant process stalled in the middle of
   workspace operations and blocking other processes).  Likewise
   detailed usage and metadata integrity checking and repair can be done
   via something like ffd_wksp_ctl check / verify / rebuild / etc.
   Practically speaking, none of this really matters if usage occurs
   predominantly during application startup / shutdown.

   completely [ret,ret+sz) and ret will be aligned to requested
   alignment.  Assumes lo and hi are non-NULL.

   fd_wksp_alloc is a simple wrapper around fd_wksp_alloc_at_least for
   use when applications do not care about details of the actual
   allocated region.

   Note that fd_wksp_alloc / fd_wksp_free are not HPC implementations.
   Instead, these are designed to be akin to a mmap / sbrk allocator of
   "last resort" under the hood in other allocators like fd_alloc.  As
   such it prioritizes packing efficiency (best fit with arbitrary sizes
   and alignments allowed) over algorithmic efficiency (e.g.
   O(lg wksp_alloc_cnt) instead of O(1) like fd_alloc) and prioritize
   robustness against heap corruption (e.g. overrunning an allocation
   might corrupt the data in other allocations but will not corrupt the
   heap structure ... as the goal of this data structure is to encourage
   minimization of TLB usage, there is very little that can be done to
   proactively prevent intraworkspace interallocation data corruption).

   These operations are "quasi-lock-free".  Specifically, while they can
   suffer priority inversion due to a slow thread stalling other threads
   from using these operations, a process that is terminated in the
   middle of these operations leaves the wksp in a recoverable state.
   The only risk is the same risk generally from any application that
   uses persistent resources: applications that are terminated abruptly
   might leave allocations in the wksp that would have been freed had
   the application terminated normally.  As the allocator has no way to
   tell the difference between such allocations and allocations that are
   intended to outlive the application, it is the caller's
   responsibility to clean up such (allocation tagging can help greatly
   simplify this for users).  It would be possible to widen this API for
   applications to explicitly signal this intent and automatically clean
   up allocations not meant to outlive their creator but the general use
   here is expected to be long lived allocations.

   Priority inversion is not expected to be an issue practically as the
   expected use case is at app startup (some non-latency critical
   processes will do a handful of wksp operations to setup workspaces
   for applications on that box going forward and then the allocations
   will not be used again until the wksp is tore down / reset / etc).
   The remaining cases (e.g. a fine grained allocator like fd_alloc
   needs to procure more memory from the workspace) are expected to be
   rare enough that the O(lg N) costs still will be more than adequate.
   Note further that fd_alloc allows very fast interprocess allocations
   to be done by using a wksp as an allocator of last resort (in such,
   all allocations would be strictly lock free unless they needed to
   invoke this allocator, as is typically the case in other lock free
   allocators).

   Likewise, operations do extensive allocation metadata integrity
   checks to facilitate robust persistent usage.  If there is metadata
   data corruption detected (e.g. hardware fault, code corruption, etc),
   there are fsck-like APIs to rebuild wksp metadata.  Data integrity
   protection is more defined by the application.

   Tags are application specific.  They can allow manual and automated
   processes to do various debugging, diagnostics, analytics and garbage
   collection on a workspace (e.g. superblocks from a fd_alloc can be
   tagged specifically for that fd_alloc to allow memory leaks in
   general to be detected at program termination with no additional
   overheads and allow such leaks cleaned up via tagged frees).
   Notably, tags are wide enough to encode gaddrs.  This opens up the
   possibly for filesystem-like complex metadata operations.

   IMPORTANT!  align technically refers to the alignment in the wksp's
   global address space.  As such, wksp must be mmaped into each local
   address space with an alignment of at least the largest alignment the
   overall application intends to use.  Common practices automatically
   satisfy this (e.g. if wksp is backed by normal/huge/gigantic pages
   and only asks for alignments of at most a normal/huge/gigantic page
   sz, this constraint is automatically satisfied as fd_shmem_join needs
   to mmap wksp into the local address space with normal/huge/gigantic
   alignment anyway).  If doing more exotic things (e.g. backing wksp by
   normal pages but requiring much larger alignments), explicitly
   specifying the wksp virtual address location (e.g. in the
   fd_shmem_join call) might be necessary to satisfy this constraint.

   This implementation support arbitrary sz and align efficiently but
   each allocation will use up 1-3 wksp partitions to achieve this.  As
   these are a finite resources (and typically sized for a wksp that
   handles primarily larger allocations, like a fd_alloc huge
   superblock) and as there are allocators like fd_alloc that faster are
   algorithmically, lower overhead and lockfree O(1) for small sizes and
   alignment, it is strongly recommended to use this as an allocator of
   last resort and/or use this for larger chunkier allocations at
   application startup (e.g. sz + align >>> cache line).  An allocator
   like fd_alloc can then manage most allocations, falling back on this
   only when necessary. */

   when the call was made and the call returned, populating the user
   provided usage structure with the result.  Always returns usage.

   wksp is a current local join to the workspace to compute usage.

   tag[tag_idx] for tag_idx in [0,tag_cnt) is an array of tags to
   compute the usage.  The order doesn't matter and, if a tag appears
   multiple times in the array, it will be counted once in the used
   stats.  A zero tag_cnt (potentially with a NULL tag) is fine
   (used_cnt,used_set for such will be 0,0).  A tag of 0 indicates to
   include free partitions in the used stats.

   total_max is the maximum partitions the wksp can have.  This will be
   positive (==part_max).

   total_sz is the number of bytes the wksp has available for
   partitioning (==data_max).  As the partitioning always covers the
   entire wksp, total_sz is constant for the lifetime of the wksp.

   total_cnt is the number of partitions the wksp currently has.  This
   will be in [1,total_max].

   free_cnt/sz is the number of free partitions / free bytes the wksp
   currently has.  A free partition has a tag of 0 and is currently
   available for splitting to satisfy the a future fd_wksp_alloc
   request.

   used_cnt/sz is the number of partitions / bytes used by wksp
   partitions whose tags match those in the provided tag set.

   This is O(wksp_alloc_cnt*tag_cnt) and will lock the wksp while
   running (and potentially block the caller if others are holding onto
   the lock).  So use in testing, etc.  Likewise, the precise meaning of
   the statistics computed by this API are dependent on the
   implementation details under the hood (that is do not be surprised if
   this API gets changed in the future). */
