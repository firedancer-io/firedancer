Usage: fd_wksp_ctl [cmd] [cmd args] [cmd] [cmd args] ...

Commands are:

help
- Prints this message.

tag val
- Sets the tag for subsequent wksp allocations to val.  Default is 1.

new wksp page_cnt page_sz cpu_idx mode
- Create a workspace named wksp from page_cnt page_sz pages near logical
  cpu_idx.  The region will have the unix permissions specified by mode
  (assumed octal).

delete wksp
- Delete a workspace named wksp.  If multiple shmem regions exist with
  same name, try to use the shmem region backed by the largest page size

alloc wksp align sz
- Allocates sz bytes with global address alignment align from the wksp
  tagged with the tag value specified above.  align 0 means use the
  default alignment.  Prints the wksp cstr address of the allocation to
  stdout on success.

free wksp_gaddr
- Free allocation pointed to by wksp cstr address wksp_gaddr.
  wksp_gaddr can point at any byte in the allocation.  Technically
  speaking, this always succeeds but logs any weirdness detected.

tag-query wksp_gaddr
- Prints the tag associated with wksp_gaddr to stdout (tags are
  positive).  If wksp_gaddr does not point to a byte in a wksp
  allocation, prints 0.  Technically speaking, this always succeeds but
  logs any weirdness detected.

tag-free wksp tag
- Free all wksp allocations with the given tag.  Technically speaking,
  this always succeeds but logs any weirdness detected.

memset wksp_gaddr c
- Memset allocation pointed to by wksp cstr address wksp_gaddr to byte
  c.  wksp_gaddr can point at any byte in the allocation.  Technically
  speaking, this always succeeds but logs any weirdness detected.

check wksp
- Check if any processes that died in middle of workspace operations
  (clean up if so) or are stalling other processes from doing workspace
  operations (log if so).

reset wksp
- Free all allocations in a workspace.

usage wksp tag
- Prints a summary of workspace usage to stdout with total, used by
  all allocs, free, and used by allocs with the given tag.  Technically
  speaking, this always succeeds but logs any weirdness detected (if
  wksp does not appear to be a wksp, prints a single line "-" to
  stdout).

query wksp
- Print the detailed workspace usage to stdout.
