/* APIs for high performance persistent inter-process shared scratch pad
   memories.  A spad as a scratch pad that behaves very much like a
   thread's stack:

   - Spad allocations are very fast O(1) assembly.

   - Spad allocations are grouped into a frames.

   - Frames are nested.

   - Pushing and popping frames are also very fast O(1) assembly.

   - All allocations in a frame are automatically freed when the frame
     is popped.

   Unlike a thread's stack, the most recent allocation can be trimmed,
   the most recent sequence of allocations be undone, operations on a
   spad can by done more than one thread, threads can operate on
   multiple spads and, if the spad is backed by a shared memory region
   (e.g. wksp), spad allocations can be shared with different processes.
   Also, it flexibly supports tight integration with real-time
   streaming, custom allocation alignments, programmatic usage queries,
   validation, and a large dynamic range of allocation sizes and
   alignments.  Further, the API can be changed at compile time to
   implementations with extra instrumentation for debugging and/or
   sanitization. */
