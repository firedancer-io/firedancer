/* Note: fd must be booted to use the APIs in this module */

/* The fd_log conceptually produces up to two log message streams for
   an application.  One is the ephemeral log message stream (aka
   "stderr") and the other is permanent log message stream ("the log
   file").  Messages to "stderr" are abbreviated as somebody watching
   this stream realtime typically already knows the stream context in
   great detail (the host, the user, the application, etc).  Messages to
   the "log file" are much more detailed and thus suitable long time
   archival purposes.

   In producing these streams, writes to the log file are prioritized
   over writes to stderr.  Further, writes to these streams are done
   quasi-atomically at message granularity to reduce the risk that
   concurrent log messages from different threads will get mixed
   together.

   Default behaviors are:

   - FD_LOG_DEBUG messages are not written to either stream (the
     argument list is still processed though so that any side effects of
     the argument list are not lost).

   - FD_LOG_INFO messages are written in detailed form to the log file
     (if the fd_log log file is setup).

   - FD_LOG_NOTICE is FD_LOG_INFO + messages are written in summary
     form to stderr.

   - FD_LOG_WARNING is FD_LOG_NOTICE + the log file and stderr are
     flushed to minimize the risk of this message and any preceding not
     making it out before thread resumption.

   - FD_LOG_ERR is FD_LOG_WARNING + the program will be exited with
     an error code of 1.

   - FD_LOG_CRIT and above are FD_LOG_WARNING + the program will
     do a backtrace if possible to the log file and stderr and, after a
     brief delay to let any pending fd_log writes complete, aborts the
     program (which typically also produces a core dump).

   These log level names mirror the Linux syslog levels.

   Useful concepts / terms:

   - An application is a collection of 1 or more thread groups that have
     common log.

   - A thread group is a collection of 1 or more threads.  (It typically
     is a process but there are unhosted situations when a more
     generalized notion of process is required.)

   - The log has a single wall clock for timestamping log messages.

   - Log messages timestamps reflect the time when log message creation
     starts.

   - Back-to-back reads of the wallclock by a thread should be
     monotonically increasing such that the order in which that thread's
     log messages were generated is accurately reflected by the
     timestamps.

   - Concurrent reads of the wallclock by different threads should be
     reasonably well synchronized such that ordering of events between
     communicating threads is accurately reflected by the timestamps.

   - A thread runs on a cpu.

   - A CPU has an architecture (x86 cores, ASIC cores, FPGAs, GPU MPUs,
     etc).

   - Multiple CPU architectures might be used by an application.

   - A host is a collection of cpus for which shared memory style
     communication primitives are reasonably efficient.

   - CPUs in a host need not share a common memory address space.

   - CPUs in a host need not share a common architecture.

   - Threads in a thread group run on the same host.

   - Threads in a thread group run on the same architecture.

   - Threads in a thread group share a common address space.

   - Threads in a thread group share a common group global variables.

   - A thread group will be part of one application for its lifetime.

   - A thread will be part of only one thread group for its lifetime.

   - A thread will run on only one host for its lifetime.

   - A thread will run on only one architecture for its lifetime.

   - An application thread's thread id is unique over all running
     threads in an application.

   - An application thread's thread id reasonably cheaply identifies the
     thread group to which the thread belongs.

   - Typically, the set of threads in a thread group will be constant
     for the lifetime of the thread group (but this is not strictly
     required).

   - Typically, the set of threads groups in an application will be
     constant for the lifetime of the application (but this is not
     strictly required).

   - Typically, a thread will run on only one CPU for its lifetime
     (but this is not strictly required).

   - Typically, a CPU will only be responsible for the execution of at
     most one application thread at any given time (but this is not
     strictly required).

   The above implies:

   * The synchronization of concurrent clock reads between two
     communicating application threads should be tighter than the
     latency for these two threads to communicate (e.g. T_send < T_recv
     is preserved).

   * The range over which the this can be done (i.e. the range of which
     the wallclock can be distributed with good synchronization and
     reasonably cheaply read) is the range over which application
     threads can be distributed.

   * There exist efficient forms of address space translation /
     virtualization to facilitate shared memory style communication
     between application threads on a host.

   * Communications between threads on different hosts is done via
     message passing.

   * Communications between threads on the same host can be done either
     by message passing or via shared memory. */

/* FD_LOG_NOTICE(( ... printf style arguments ... )) will send a message
   at the NOTICE level to the logger.  E.g. for a typical fd_log
   configuration:

     FD_LOG_NOTICE(( "%lu is the loneliest number", 1UL ));

   would log something like:

     NOTICE  01-23 04:56:07.890123 45678 f0 0 src/file.c(901): 1 is the loneliest number

   to the ephemeral log (stderr) and log something like:

     NOTICE  2023-01-23 04:56:07.890123456 GMT-06 45678:45678 user:host:f0 app:thread:0 src/file.c(901)[func]: 1 is the loneliest number

   to the permanent log (log file).  Similarly for the other log levels.
   Additional logger details are described at the top of this file.

   FD_LOG_NOTICE has a hexdump counterpart that essentially behaves
   like:

     void
     FD_LOG_HEXDUMP_NOTICE(( char const * tag,
                             void const * mem,
                             ulong        sz ));

   This logs pretty printed details about memory region to the log
   streams at the NOTICE log severity level.

   tag points to a cstr that is intended to be a human-readable /
   greppable tag describing the memory region.  As such, it is strongly
   recommended that tag points to a cstr containing only printable
   characters with no internal double quotes (but this is not enforced
   currently).  There are no length restrictions on the cstr but the
   logger under the hood might detectably truncate excessively long tags
   (e.g. strlen(tag) >> 32) due to internal implementation limitations.
   NULL and/or empty tags ("") are fine and will be detectably logged.

   mem points to the first byte of the memory region to hexdump and sz
   is the number of bytes in the region.  There are no limits on sz but
   the number of bytes logged might be limited due to internal
   implementation details (e.g. sz >> 1500 bytes).  NULL mem and/or 0 sz
   are fine and will be detectably logged.

   The lifetime the cstr and the memory region must be at least from the
   call entry to call return.

   E.g. for a typical fd_log configuration:

     FD_LOG_HEXDUMP_WARNING(( "bad_pkt", pkt, pkt_sz ));

   would log something like:

     WARNING 01-23 04:56:07.890123 75779 f0 0 src/file.c(901): HEXDUMP "bad_pkt" (96 bytes at 0x555555561a4e)

   to the ephemeral log (stderr) and similarly to the permanent log.

   Similarly for hexdumping to other log levels.

   Note: fd_log_wallclock called outside the arg list to give it a
   linguistically strict point when it is called that is before logging
   activities commence.

   This family of functions is not async-signal safe. Do not call log functions from
   a signal handler, it may deadlock or corrupt the log. If you wish to write
   emergency diagnostics, you can call `write(2)` directly to stderr or the log file,
   which is safe. */
