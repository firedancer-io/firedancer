/* Clears the environment variables of the process by explicitly zeroing

   values).  The envirnment is also cleared using clearenv(3) to make
   sure any callers of getenv(3) will no longer see the environment as
   being present (albeit zeroed).

   Environment variables are a common source of information leakage:
   they can appear in logs and crash dumps, and are accessible to other
   processses on the machine.
   
   Firedancer does not use environment variables to pass information,
   but it is possible an operator has passed unneeded variables in when
   launching the program, and we discard them here to make sure they do
   not get leaked. */

   If a file descriptor is open in the process that is not in the list,
   or a file descriptor that's present in the list is not open in the
   process an error is raised and the program is aborted.

   The security of the sandbox depends on the file descriptor table
   being exactly as expected.  For example if the process has a handle
   open to /etc/shadow, the sandbox is not secure.

   This is a defense in depth measure and mostly catches programming
   errors introduced when changing the startup sequence of the program,
   but it also catches cases where systemd or some other init system has
   spawned the Firedancer process with unexpected file descriptors still
   open.

/* User namespaces have a mapping from user and group IDs inside the
   namespace to corresponding IDs outside the namespace.  When creating
   a namespace the process gets one chance to write these mappings into
   special /proc files before they are locked in place.  See
   user_namespaces(7) for more details.

   This function writes these special files, with a single mapping: the
   UID and GID of "1" inside the namespace are mapped to the provided
   UID and GID in the parent namespace.  The function should be called
   immediately after creating a user namespace, before doing anything
   else in the namespace. The provided UID and GID should be the same
   as the effective UID and GID of the process that created the user
   namespace.

   The IDs inside the namespace are arbitrary, we could use any number,
   but theres a small benefit to avoiding zero, as we won't be "root"
   within the namespace.  This doesn't matter in practice, root within
   the namespace has no permissions outside of it -- but it protects
   against a potential unknown kernel bug.
   
   Before writing these maps we have to do an additional step: write
   the string "deny" to /proc/self/setgroups.  This is required by the
   kernel as a security measure.  See user_namespaces(7) again for more
   information */

   To support this, the caller needs to create two nested user
   namespaces, and call this inside the first user namespace.  It will
   set the maximum allowed namespaces to zero for everything except
   user namespaces where one more (the soon to be nested one) is
