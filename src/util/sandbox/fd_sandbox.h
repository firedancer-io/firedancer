/* The purpose of the sandbox is to reduce the impact of a Firedancer
   compromise.

   A process should call fd_sandbox as soon as is practically possible,
   by identifying the specific set of privileged actions it needs to
   perform.  A typical boot sequence might look something like,

      fd_boot();
      perform_privileged_setup();
      fd_sandbox();
      run_as_sandboxed();

   Calling fd_sandbox() itself requires root or CAP_SYS_ADMIN, which is
   counterintuitive but a limitation of the Linux kernel.  This is not
   because it is doing anything privileged, but unsharing a user
   namespace is a privileged operation.

   If full_sandbox is zero, then the sandbox is not enabled at all.  The
   only step that will be performed is switching UID and GID to the
   provided ones.  All other arguments are ignored.

   The rlimit_file_cnt argument determines what RLIMIT_NOFILE is set to.
   This should almost always be zero.  It does not affect already open
   descriptors, and only is in effect for future syscalls.  It is
   only needed for cases where poll() or similar syscalls are used which
   require RLIMIT_NOFILE values to be increased for no particular
   reason.

   The seccomp_filter argument is a list of BPF instructions which will
   get loaded into the kernel seccomp filter.  You should never
   construct such a filter by hand.  ALWAYS generate filters from a
   policy file with the script in contrib/generate_filters.py

   Note that it is preferable to minimize the amount of code that
   happens before sandboxing, but it is even more preferable to have a
   stronger sandbox by allowing less system calls.  Where these two are
   in conflict, the privileged setup should do more, and the sandbox
   should allow less.  For example, it is much better to call socket()
   to open a socket during the privileged stage and save the descriptor
   for the unprivileged phase, than to allow the socket() syscall while
   sandboxed.

   After sandboxing almost nothing will be available.  The process
   cannot make syscalls except those allowed, has no filesystem, no
   network access, no privileges or capabilities.  Almost all it can do
   absent additional syscalls is read and write memory, and execute
   already mapped code pages.

   Typically the only things are process will need to do while
   privileged are read files and map memory.

   Calling fd_sandbox will do each of the following, in order,

    * The list of open file descriptors for the process is checked
      against the allowed list, allow_fds.  If the file descriptor table
      is not an exact match (an expected file descriptor is not present,
      or an unexpected one is open) the program will abort with an
      error.

    * The real user ID, effective user ID, and the saved set-user-ID of
      the process are switched to the provided uid, if they are not
      already.  Your process will now be running as the unprivileged
      user.

    * The real group ID, effective group ID, and the saved-set-group-ID
      of the process are switched to the provided gid, if they are not
      already.

    * Almost all namespaces that can be unshared are unshared,
      CLONE_NEWUSER, CLONE_NEWNS, CLONE_NEWNET, CLONE_NEWCGROUP,
      CLONE_NEWIPC, CLONE_NEWUTS.  The PID namespace, CLONE_NEWPID is
      not unshared, as it requires cloning a new child.

    * The user namespace is set up so that Firedancer runs as root
      inside it, but that the root user in the namespace maps to the
      provided UID and GID outside.

    * The dumpable bit is cleared, so the process will not produce core
      dumps.

    * The capability bounding set is cleared.

    * The RLIMIT_NOFILE rlimit is set to the parameter rlimit_file_cnt,
      so no new files can be opened above this limit.  This is an
      additional layer, as usually open() syscalls will be prevented as
      well.

    * CLONE_NEWNS, the mount namespace is unshared.  The process is
      given a new global mount namespace, a temporary directory with
      nothing in it.

    * All capabilities are dropped in the running process, which were
      already only applying to the user namespace.

    * Secure bits, (SECBIT_KEEP_CAPS_LOCKED, SECBIT_NO_SETUID_FIXUP,
      ...) are all cleared.

    * Ambient capabilities are cleared.

    * The process environment is fully cleared, and the memory is
      overwritten with zeros to prevent any secrets from being leaked.

    * The PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS bit is set.

    * Finally, a seccomp filter is installed which restricts which
      syscalls are allowed, and their arguments, to a list provided by
      the user. */
