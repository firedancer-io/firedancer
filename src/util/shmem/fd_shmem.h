/* User APIs **********************************************************/

/* fd_shmem_{join,leave} joins/leaves the caller to/from a named fd
   shared memory region.

   It is very convenient to be able to join the same region multiple
   times within a thread group.  And it is safe and reasonably efficient
   to do so (O(1) but neither lockfree nor ultra HPC).  To facilitate
   this, when a join requires mapping the region into the thread group's
   local address space (e.g. the first join to the region in the thread
   group), this will try to discover the page size that is backing the
   region (if there multiple regions with same name, this will try to
   join the one backed by the largest page size).  Then the region is
   mapped into the address appropriately for the given access mode
   (FD_SHMEM_JOIN_MODE_{READ_ONLY,READ_WRITE}).  Lastly, any user
   provided fd_shmem_join_func_t is called on the mapping.

   A fd_shmem_join_func_t is meant to do any additional local address
   translations and what not as a one-time upfront cost on behalf of all
   subsequent joins.  It is called if the underlying shared memory needs
   to be mapped into the thread group's address space and ignored
   otherwise.  The input to a join_func is a pointer to any user context
   (i.e. the context passed to fd_shmem_join) and a pointer to
   information about the region (lifetime is the duration of the call
   and should not be assumed to be longer).

   On success, a join_func returns the join that wraps the shmem (often
   just a shmem); it should be one-to-one with shmem (i.e. while a
   thread group is joined, name cstr / shmem / join uniquely identify
   the name cstr / shmem / join).  On failure, a join_func returns NULL
   (ideally without impacting thread group state while logging details
   about the failure).

   Pass NULL for join_func if no special handling is needed.  The join
   handle will be just a pointer to the first byte of the region's local
   mapping.

   All joins should be paired with a leave.

   On success, if opt_info is non-NULL, *opt_info will also provide
   additional details about the join (i.e. the same details one would
   get if querying the join atomically with respect to join operations
   immediately afterward).  On failure, *opt_info is ignored.

   fd_shmem_leave is just the inverse of this.  It cannot fail from the
   caller's POV (but will log extensive details if there is any
   wonkiness under the hood).

   IMPORTANT!  It is safe to have join/leave functions themselves call
   fd_shmem_join/fd_shmem_leave to join additional regions as necessary.
   This allows very complex interdependent shared memory topologies to
   be constructed in a natural way.  The only restriction (beyond the
   total number of regions that can be joined) is that there can't be
   join/leave cycles (e.g. fd_shmem_join("region1") calls join_func
   region1_join("region1") which calls fd_shmem_join("region2") which
   calls join_func region2_join("region2") which calls
   shmem_join("region1")).  Such cycles will be detected, logged and
   failed. */

/* fd_shmem_join_query_by_{name,join,addr} queries if the cstr pointed
   by name is already joined by the caller's thread group / the join
   handle is a valid current join handle / [addr,addr+sz-1] overlaps (at
   least partially) with a shared memory region of a current join.

   On success, returns 0 and, if opt_info non-NULL, *opt_info will hold
   details about the join (as observed at a point between when the call
   was made and when it returned).  On failure, returns a non-zero
   strerror friendly error code (these do not log anything so they can
   be use in situations where the query might fail in normal operation
   without being excessively chatty in the log).  Reasons for failure
   include name is not valid (EINVAL) and there is no join currently
   (ENOENT).

   For query_by_addr, returns ENOENT if sz is 0 (no overlap with an
   empty set) and EINVAL if the address range wrapps around the end of
   address space.  If there are multiple joins overlapped by the range,
   returns 0 and, if opt_info is non-NULL, *opt_info will have details
   about one of the joins (it is undefined which join).  Note it is
   impossible for a range to overlap multiple joins when sz==1.

   Other code in the thread group can fd_shmem_join( name, ... ) as

   name in the thread group.  This is useful to allow memory regions
