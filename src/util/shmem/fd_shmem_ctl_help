Usage: fd_shmem_ctl [cmd] [cmd args] [cmd] [cmd args] ...
Commands are:

help
- Prints this message

cpu-cnt
- Prints number of cpus on a single line

numa-cnt
- Prints number of numa nodes on a single line

cpu-idx numa-idx
- If numa-idx gives the index of a valid NUMA node (e.g. in [0,numa-cnt)
  and has at least one CPU close to it), prints on a single line the
  lowest indexed cpu in base-10; the result will be in [0,cpu-cnt).
- Otherwise, prints '-' on a single line to stdout.

numa-idx cpu-idx
- If cpu-idx gives the index of a valid cpu (e.g. in [0,cpu-cnt) and
  usable), prints on a single line the index of the NUMA node the cpu is
  closest in base-10; the result will be in [0,numa-cnt).
- Otherwise, prints '-' on a single line to stdout.

create name page_cnt page_sz cpu_idx mode
- Create a shared memory region named name from page_cnt page_sz pages
  near logical cpu_idx.  The region will have the unix permissions
  specified by mode (assumed octal).

unlink name page_sz
- Unlinks a page_sz page backed shared memory region named name.
- If page_sz is zero, this will attempt to detected the page_sz.  If
  there are multiple with the same name, one will be deleted (typically
  the one backed by the largest page_sz).

query name page_sz
- Pretty prints info to stdout about a shared memory region named name.
  The format is:
    [err_code] [page_cnt] [page_sz]
  err code is zero, the query was successful.  If not, the query
  failed (details logged) and page_cnt and page_sz will be zero.
- If page_sz is zero, this will attempt to detected the page_sz.
  If there are multiple with the same name, one will be queried
  (typically the one backed by the largest page_sz).
