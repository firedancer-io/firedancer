/* API for platform agnostic high performance stream I/O.  Summary:

   Read at least min bytes directly from stream fd into size max buffer
   buf (1<=min<=max):

     ulong rsz; int err = fd_io_read( fd, buf, min, max, &rsz );
     if     ( FD_LIKELY( err==0 ) ) ... success, rsz in [min,max], buf updated
     else if( FD_LIKELY( err< 0 ) ) ... EOF encountered, rsz is [0,min), buf updated
     else                           ... I/O error, rsz is zero, buf clobbered
                                    ... err is strerror compat, err is neither EAGAIN nor EWOULDBLOCK
                                    ... fd should be considered failed

   This usage will block (even if the stream is non-blocking) until min
   bytes are read, EOF is encountered or there is an I/O error.  As
   such, the min==1 case behaves like a POSIX read on a blocking stream.
   The min==max case will read an exact number of bytes from the stream
   and return an error if this is not possible.  The 1<min<max case is
   useful for implementing buffered I/O.

   A non-blocking read on a non-blocking stream is possible by setting
   min==0:

     ulong rsz; int err = fd_io_read( fd, buf, 0UL, max, &rsz );
     if     ( FD_LIKELY( err==0      ) ) ... success, rsz in [1,max], buf updated
     else if( FD_LIKELY( err==EAGAIN ) ) ... try again later, rsz is zero, buf unchanged
     else if( FD_LIKELY( err< 0      ) ) ... EOF encountered, rsz is zero, buf unchanged
     else                                ... I/O error, rsz is zero, buf clobbered
                                         ... err is strerror compat, err is neither EAGAIN nor EWOULDBLOCK
                                         ... fd should be considered failed

   (If min==0 and stream fd is blocking, the EAGAIN case will never
   occur.)

   Write is nearly symmetrical to read.

   Write at least min byte and at most max bytes from buf into stream fd
   (1<=min<=max):

     ulong wsz; int err = fd_io_write( fd, buf, min, max, &wsz );
     if( FD_LIKELY( err==0 ) ) ... success, wsz in [min,max]
     else                      ... I/O error, wsz is zero, how much of buf was streamed before the error is unknown
                               ... err is strerror compat, err is neither EAGAIN nor EWOULDBLOCK
                               ... fd should be considered failed

   This usage will block (even if the stream is non-blocking) until min
   bytes are written or there is an I/O error.  As such, the min==1 case
   behaves like a POSIX write on a stream.  The min==max case will write
   an exact number of bytes to fd and give an error if this is not
   possible.  The 1<min<max case is useful for implementing buffered
   I/O.

   A non-blocking write on a non-blocking stream is possible by setting
   min==0:

     ulong wsz; int err = fd_io_write( fd, buf, 0UL, max, &wsz );
     if     ( FD_LIKELY( err==0      ) ) ... success, wsz in [1,max]
     else if( FD_LIKELY( err==EAGAIN ) ) ... try again later, wsz is zero
     else                                ... I/O error, wsz is zero, how much of buf was streamed before the error is unknown
                                         ... err is strerror compat, err is neither EAGAIN nor EWOULDBLOCK
                                         ... fd should be considered failed

   (If min==0 and stream fd is blocking, the EAGAIN case will never
   occur.)

   Each call above typically requires at least one system call.  This
   can be inefficient if doing lots of tiny reads and writes.  For
   higher performance usage in cases like this, buffered I/O APIs are
   also provided.

   Buffered reads:

     ... setup buffered reads from stream fd using the rbuf_sz size
     ... buffer rbuf (rbuf_sz>0) as the read buffer

     fd_io_buffered_istream_t in[1];
     fd_io_buffered_istream_init( in, fd, rbuf, rbuf_sz );
     ... in is initialized and has ownership of fd and rbuf

     ... accessors (these return the values used to init in)

     int    fd      = fd_io_buffered_istream_fd     ( in );
     void * rbuf    = fd_io_buffered_istream_rbuf   ( in );
     ulong  rbuf_sz = fd_io_buffered_istream_rbuf_sz( in );

     ... read sz bytes from a buffered stream

     int err = fd_io_buffered_istream_read( in, buf, sz );
     if     ( FD_LIKELY( err==0 ) ) ... success, buf holds the next sz bytes of stream
     else if( FD_LIKELY( err< 0 ) ) ... EOF before sz bytes could be read, buf clobbered
     else                           ... I/O error, buf clobbered
                                    ... err is strerror compat, err is neither EAGAIN nor EWOULDBLOCK
                                    ... in and fd should be considered failed

     ... skip sz bytes in a buffered stream

     else if( FD_LIKELY( err< 0      ) ) ... end-of-file,     peek_sz updated to unconsumed bytes remaining (at most rbuf_sz)
     else if( FD_LIKELY( err==EAGAIN ) ) ... try again later, peek_sz unchanged
     else                                ... I/O error,       peek_sz unchanged

FD_PROTOTYPES_BEGIN

/* fd_io_read streams at least dst_min bytes from the given file
   descriptor into the given memory region.  fd should be an open
   normal-ish file descriptor (it is okay for fd to be non-blocking).
   dst points in the caller's address space with arbitrary alignment to
   the first byte of the dst_max byte memory region to use (assumes dst
   non-NULL, dst_max is positive and dst_min is at most dst_max).  The
   caller should not read or write this region during the call and no
   interest in dst is retained on return.  If dst_min is 0, this will
   try to read dst_max from the stream exactly once.

   Returns 0 on success.  On success, *_dst_sz will be the number of
   bytes read into dst.  Will be in [dst_min,dst_max].

   Returns a negative number if end-of-file was encountered before
   reading dst_min bytes.  *_dst_sz will be the number bytes read into
   dst when the end-of-file was encountered.  Will be in [0,dst_min).

   Returns an errno compatible error code on failure (note that all
   errnos are positive).  If errno is anything other than EAGAIN, the
   underlying fd should be considered to be in a failed state such that
   the only valid operation on fd is to close it.  *_dst_sz will be zero
   and the contents of dst will be undefined.  This API fixes up the
   POSIX glitches around EWOULDBLOCK / EAGAIN: if the underlying target
   has EWOULDBLOCK different from EAGAIN and read uses EWOULDBLOCK
   instead of EAGAIN, this will still just return EAGAIN.  EAGAIN will
   only be returned if the underlying fd is non-blocking and dst_min is
   zero.

   TL;DR

   - dst_min is positive:

       ulong dst_sz; int err = fd_io_read( fd, dst, dst_min, dst_max, &dst_sz );
       if     ( FD_LIKELY( err==0 ) ) ... success, dst_sz in [dst_min,dst_max], dst updated
       else if( FD_LIKELY( err< 0 ) ) ... EOF, dst_sz in [0,dst_min), dst updated
       else                           ... I/O error, dst_sz is zero, dst clobbered
                                      ... err is strerror compat, err is neither EAGAIN nor EWOULDBLOCK
                                      ... fd should be considered failed

     This is equivalent to looping over reads of up to dst_max in size
     from fd until at least dst_min bytes are read.  It does not matter
     if fd is blocking or not.

   - dst_min is zero and fd is blocking:

       ulong dst_sz; int err = fd_io_read( fd, dst, dst_min, dst_max, &dst_sz );
       if     ( FD_LIKELY( err==0 ) ) ... success, dst_sz in [1,dst_max], dst updated
       else if( FD_LIKELY( err< 0 ) ) ... EOF, dst_sz is zero, dst unchanged
       else                           ... I/O error, dst_sz is zero, dst clobbered
                                      ... err is strerror compat, err is neither EAGAIN nor EWOULDBLOCK
                                      ... fd should be considered failed

     This is equivalent to a single read of dst_max size on a blocking
     fd.

   - dst_min is zero and fd is non-blocking:

       ulong dst_sz; int err = fd_io_read( fd, dst, dst_min, dst_max, &dst_sz );
       if     ( FD_LIKELY( err==0      ) ) ... success, dst_sz in [1,dst_max], dst updated
       else if( FD_LIKELY( err==EAGAIN ) ) ... no data available now, try again later, dst_sz is zero, dst unchanged
       else if( FD_LIKELY( err< 0      ) ) ... EOF, dst_sz is zero, dst unchanged
       else                                ... I/O error, dst_sz is zero, dst clobbered
                                           ... err is strerror compat, err is neither EAGAIN nor EWOULDBLOCK
                                           ... fd should be considered failed

     This is equivalent to a single read of dst_max size on a
     non-blocking fd (with the POSIX glitches around EAGAIN /
     EWOULDBLOCK cleaned up). */

/* fd_io_buffered_read is like fd_io_read but can consolidate many

   immediately returns success).  Will block the caller until the read
   is complete or an end-of-file was encountered.

   rbuf points to the first byte of a rbuf_sz size memory region in the
   caller's address space used for read buffering (assumes rbuf is
   non-NULL with arbitrary alignment and rbuf_sz is positive).  On entry
   *_rbuf_lo is where the first byte of unconsumed buffered reads are

   Returns 0 on success.  dst will hold dst_sz bytes from the stream.
   *_rbuf_lo and *_rbuf_ready will be updated and the above invariant on
   *_rbuf_lo and *_rbuf_ready will still hold.

   Returns non-zero on failure.  Failure indicates that dst_sz bytes

   fd_io_write, src NULL is okay if src_sz is 0 (src_sz 0 is a no-op
   that immediately returns success).  Will block the caller until the
   write is complete or an end-of-file was encountered.

   wbuf points to the first byte of a wbuf_sz size memory region in the
   caller's address space (assumes wbuf is non-NULL with arbitrary
   alignment and wbuf_sz is positive).  On entry *_wbuf_used is the
   number of bytes in wbuf from previous buffered writes that have not
   yet been streamed out.  Assumes *_wbuf_used is in [0,wbuf_sz].

   Returns 0 on success.  wbuf will hold *_wbuf_used bytes not yet
   written to fd by write and/or previous buffered writes.  The above
   invariant on *_wbuf_used will still hold.

   Returns non-zero on failure.  Failure indicates that src_sz bytes
   could not be written because of an I/O error (return will be a
   positive errno compatible error code).  fd should be considered to be
   in a failed state such that the only valid operation on it is to
   close it.  *_wbuf_used will be 0 and the contents of wbuf will be
   undefined.  Zero or more bytes of previously buffered writes and/or
   src might have been written before the failure.

   IMPORTANT!  This function will only write to fd in multiples of
   wbuf_sz.  This can be useful for various ultra high performance
   contexts.

   This API usually should not be used directly.  It is mostly useful
   for implementing higher level APIs like fd_io_buffered_ostream below. */
