/* APIs provided by compiler sanitizers.

   Sanitizers are error detection tools built from a combination of
   hardware facilities, hooks injected into compiled code,
   special memory mappings, and library functions.

   For example, the AddressSanitizer can be used to detect out-of-bounds
   memory accesses that otherwise don't crash a process and various
   other undefined behavior. */
