/* fd_cstr_to_T converts the cstr pointed at by s into a T and returns
   its value.  Caller promises s is non-NULL and points at a cstr.

   Note fd_cstr_to_cstr just returns s.  As such the lifetime of the
   returned pointer is the lifetime s and ownership model of the
   underlying s is defined by the application.

   fd_cstr_to_char just returns the first character of the cstr (if cstr
   is the empty string, this will be the '\0' character ... otherwise,
   it will be a normal string character).  As char do not have a
   consistent interpretation between platforms due to issues with the
   language standard itself, the value here should just be treated as a
   character and not an integer.  Use fd_cstr_schar/fd_cstr_uchar if you
   need to treat a char as an integer.

   fd_cstr_to_cstr and fd_cstr_to_char exist primarily for type system
   completeness / facilitate various generic programming practices.

   The integer converters work in the strtol sense with base 0 (and thus
   ignore leading whitespace, handle leading signs and assume octal if
   the body is prefixed with 0, hexadecimal if prefixed with 0x and
   decimal otherwise). */

   in-place, into:

     [WS][TOKEN 0][NUL][WS][TOKEN 1][NUL]...[WS][TOKEN tok_cnt-1][NUL]

   and returns tok_cnt.

   Further, on return, tok[i] for i in [0,min(tok_cnt,tok_max)) where
   tok_cnt is the number of tokens in cstr will point to the first
   byte of each token.  Due to the tokenization, each one of these will
   be properly '\0' terminated.

   Above, [WS] is a sequence of zero or more whitespace characters,
   [TOKEN *] are a sequence of zero or more non-delim and non-NUL
   characters and delim is assumed to be a non-NUL non-whitespace
   character (e.g. ',').

   As such:
   - The original cstr is clobbered by this call.
   - tok[*] point to a properly terminated cstr into the original cstr
     on return.  They thus have the same lifetime issues as the original
     cstr.
   - If tok_cnt > tok_max, tok wasn't large enough to hold all the
     tokens found in the cstr.  Only the first max are available in
     tok[*] (the entire string was still tokenized though).
   - Found tokens will not have any leading whitespace.
   - Found tokens might have internal or trailing whitespace.
   - Zero length tokens are possible.  E.g. assuming delim==':', the cstr
     "a: b::d: :f" has the tokens: "a", "b", "", "d", "", "f".
   - If the final token is zero length, it should use an explicit
     delimiter.  E.g. assuming delim=='|':
       "a|b"     has tokens "a", "b"
       "a|b|"    has tokens "a", "b"
       "a|b| "   has tokens "a", "b"
       "a|b||"   has tokens "a", "b", ""
       "a|b| |"  has tokens "a", "b", ""
       "a|b| | " has tokens "a", "b", ""
   - This is also true if the final token is the initial token.  E.g.
     assuming delim==';':
       ""    has no tokens
       " "   has no tokens
       ";"   has the token ""
       " ;"  has the token ""
       " ; " has the token "" */
