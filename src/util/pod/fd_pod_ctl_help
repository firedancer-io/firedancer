Usage: fd_pod_ctl [cmd] [cmd args] [cmd] [cmd args] ...

Commands are:

help
- Prints this message.

tag val
- Sets the tag for subsequent wksp allocations to val.  Default is 1.

new wksp max
- Create a pod in wksp with a maximum size of max.  Prints the wksp cstr
  address of the (empty) pod to stdout on success.  0 indicates to use a
  default of 4KiB.

delete pod
- Delete the pod at wksp cstr address pod.

reset pod
- Reset the pod at wksp cstr address pod.

list pod
- Lists (recursively) the contents of the pod at wksp cstr address pod
  to stdout.

insert pod type path val
- Inserts type into the pod at path with value val.  Fails if path
  already exists in the pod.  This might change the locations of
  existing values in the pod.  If type is cstr, val is converted to a
  c-style string and inserted into pod.  Similarly:
    char  -> single character,
    schar ->  8-bit signed integer (twos complement), uchar  ->  8-bit unsigned integer,
    short -> 16-bit signed integer (twos complement), ushort -> 16-bit unsigned integer,
    int   -> 32-bit signed integer (twos complement), uint   -> 32-bit unsigned integer,
    long  -> 64-bit signed integer (twos complement), ulong  -> 64-bit unsigned integer,
    float -> 32-bit real (IEEE-754),                  double -> 64-bit real (IEEE-754)

insert-file pod path file
- Inserts a "buf" type into the pod at path.  The buffer will contain the
  entire contents of the file at path "file" into the pod.  Fails if
  path already exists in the pod.  This might change the locations of
  existing values in the pod.  The size of the buffer will be number of
  bytes in the file and it is fine to insert a zero sized file into the
  pod.  TODO: consider allowing users to specify other types and/or
  regions of the file?

remove pod path
- Remove the path (and any path.*) from the pod.  Fails if path does not
  already exist in the pod.  This might change the locations of existing
  values in the pod

update pod type path val
- Update path to val (failing if path to type does not already exist).
  Specifically, in pseudocode:

    t = query type pod path  ... check if path to type exists
    if t!=type, fail         ... no
    remove pod path          ... remove old val
    insert pod type path val ... insert new val

  In the current implementation, if the insert fails, the original value
  will be lost.  This might change the locations of existing values in
  the pod.

set pod type path val
- Set path to val (inserting path if path does not already exist).  Will
  not change the type at end of any existing path.  Specifically, in
  pseudocode:

    t = query type pod path       ... check if path exists
    if   t==type, remove pod path ... yes and to right type 
    elif t!=void, fail            ... yes but to wrong type
    fi                            ... no
    insert pod type val           ... insert new val

  In the current implementation, if the insert fails, the original value
  at path (if any) will be lost.  This might change the locations of
  existing values in the pod.

compact pod full
- Compacts the pod.  If full is non-zero, a full compaction is done
  (pod_max set to pod_used and the pod header is compacted).  This might
  change the locations of existing values in the pod.

query-root what pod
- Query pod.  The "what" determines what will be printed to stdout as a
  result of the query.

    what \ pod | exists             | does not exist
    -----------+--------------------+---------------
    test       | 0                  | neg error code
    max        | max bytes in pod   | 0
    used       | used bytes in pod  | 0
    avail      | free bytes in pod  | 0
    cnt        | num keys in pod    | 0
    recursive  | num keys in pod    |
               | (recursively)      | 0
    subpod-cnt | num subpods in pod | 0

  Technically speaking, this always succeeds but any weirdness detected
  is logged.

query what pod path
- Query pod for path.  The "what" determines what will be printed to
  stdout as a result of the query.

    what \ pod:path | exists                  | does not exist
    ----------------+-------------------------+---------------
    test            | 0                       | neg error code
    type            | value type              | void
    val             | pretty print value      | void
    max             | max bytes in pod:path   | 0
    used            | used bytes in pod:path  | 0
    avail           | free bytes in pod:path  | 0
    cnt             | num keys in pod:path    | 0
    recursive       | num keys in pod:path    |
                    | (recursively)           | 0
    subpod-cnt      | num subpods in pod:path | 0
    gaddr           | wksp gaddr of the       |
                    | pod encoded value       | null
    full            |             pretty print verbose query

  Technically speaking, this always succeeds but any weirdness detected
  is logged.

The current implementation assumes no concurrent pod users.
