   as it consumes two slots).  Passes various strict PRNG tests (e.g.
   diehard, dieharder, testu01, etc).  Assumes rng is a current join.
   fd_rng_{schar,short,int,long} are the same but return a value in
   [0,2^(N-1)).  (A signed generator that can assume all possible values
   of a signed int uniform IID can be obtained by casting the output of
   the unsigned generator of the same, assuming a typical twos
   complement arithmetic platform.)
   
   The theory for this that fd_ulong_hash(i) for i in [0,2^64) specifies
   a random looking permutation of the integers in [0,2^64).  Returning
   the low order bits of this random permutation then yields a high
   quality non-cryptographic random number stream automatically as it:

   - Has a long period (2^64).  This is implied by the permutation
     property.

   - Has the expected random properties (as theoretically best possible
     for a finite period generator) of a true uniform IID bit source.
     For example, the probability of next random number is uniform and
     independent of previous N random numbers for N<<2^64).  This is
     also implied by the full avalanche and permutation property.

   - Is "unpredictable".  That is, the internal state of the generator
     is difficult to recover from its outputs, e.g. a return from
     fd_rng_uint could be have been generated from 2^32 internal states
     (if the sequence is known), up to 2^32 sequences (if the state is
     known) and up to 2^64 (state,seq) pairs neither is known (the state
     / sequence is potentially recoverable given a long enough stream of
     values though).  This is implied by the truncation of hash values.

   To turn this into parameterizable family of generators, note that
   fd_ulong_hash( perm_j( i ) ) where j is some parameterized family of
   random permutations is still a permutation and would have all the
   above properties for free so long as no perm_j is similar to the hash
   permutation inverse.  Practically, xoring i by a non-sparse 64-bit
   number will ultra cheaply generate a wide family of "good enough"
   permutations to do a parameterized shuffling of the original
   fd_ulong_hash permutation, creating a large number of parallel
   sequences.  Since users are empirically notoriously bad at seeding
   though, we only let the user specify a 32-bit sequence id and then
   generate a unique non-sparse 64-bit random looking seed from it. */

/* fd_rng_{uint_to_float,ulong_to_double}_{c0,c1,c,o}( u ):  These
   quickly and robustly convert uniform random integers into uniform
   random floating point with appropriate rounding.  Intervals are:

     c0 -> [0,1)
     c1 -> (0,1]
     c  -> [0,1]
     o  -> (0,1)

   To provide more specifics, let the real numbers from [0,1) be
   partitioned into N uniform disjoint intervals such that interval i
   goes from [i/N,(i+1)/N) where i is in [0,N).  For single (double)
   precision, "float" ("double"), the largest N for which the range of
   each interval is _exactly_ representable is N = 2^24 (2^53).

   Given then a uniform IID uint random input, the
   fd_rng_uint_to_float_c0 converter output is as though a continuous
   IID uniform random in [0,1) was generated and then rounded down to
   the start of the containing interval (2^24 intervals).  As such, this
   generator can never return exactly 1 but it can exactly return +0.
   Since floats have higher resolution near 0 than 1, this will not
   return all float possible representations in [0,1) but it can return
   all possible float representations in [1/2,1).  In particular, this
   will never return a denorm or -0.

   Similarly for fd_rng_uint_to_float_c1 converter rounds up to the end
   of the containing interval / start of the next interval (2^24
   intervals).  As such, this converter can never return exactly +0 but
   it can exactly return 1.  It will not return all possible float
   representations in (0,1] but it can return all possible float
   representations in [1/2,1].  This will never return a denorm or -0.

   The fd_rng_uint_to_float_c converter rounds toward nearest even
   toward the start containing interval or start of the next interval
   (2^24 intervals).  As such, this can return both exactly +0 and
   exactly 1 (and the probability of returning exactly +0 == probability
   of exactly 1 == (1/2) probability all other possible return values).
   It will not return all possible float representations in [0,1] but it
   can return all float possible representations in [1/2,1].  This will
   never return a denorm or -0.

   The fd_rng_uint_to_float_o converter rounds toward the middle of
   containing internal (2^23 intervals ... note that then in a sense
   this converter is 1-bit less accurate than the above).  As such, this
   can neither return +0 nor 1 and will not return all possible float
   representations in (0,1).  This will never return a denorm or -0.

   and o uses 2^52 intervals). */
