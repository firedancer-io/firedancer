/* TODO: Some optimizations, cleanups, future work:
   1. Simple data types (ulong, int, etc) should be stored as their
      underlying type instead of a byte array.
   2. Perhaps make the query/modify scoping more explicit. Right now,
      the caller is free to use the API wrong if there are no locks.
      Maybe just expose a different API if there are no locks?
   3. Rename locks to suffix with _query_locking and _query_locking_end
   4. Replace memset with custom constructors for new banks.
   5. Don't templatize out more complex types.

/* A fd_bank_t struct is the representation of the bank state on Solana
   for a given block. More specifically, the bank state corresponds to
   all information needed during execution that is not stored on-chain,
   but is instead cached in a validator's memory. Each of these bank
   fields are repesented by a member of the fd_bank_t struct.

   Management of fd_bank_t structs must be fork-aware: the state of each
   fd_bank_t must be based on the fd_bank_t of it's parent block. This
   state is managed by the fd_banks_t struct.

   In order to support fork-awareness, there are several key features
   that fd_banks_t and fd_bank_t MUST support:
   1. Query for any non-rooted block's bank: create a fast lookup
      from block id to bank
   2. Be able to create a new bank for a given block from the bank of
      that block's parent and maintain some tree-like structure to
      track the parent-child relationships: copy the contents from a
      parent bank into a child bank.
   3. Prune the set of active banks to keep the root updated as the
      network progresses: free resources of fd_bank_t structs that
      are are not direct descendants of the root bank (remove parents
      and any competing lineages).
   4. Each bank will have field(s) that are concurrently read/write
      from multiple threads: add read-write locks to the fields that are
      concurrently written to.
   5. In practice, a bank state for a given block can be very large and
      not all of the fields are written to every block. Therefore, it can
      be very expensive to copy the entire bank state for a given block
      each time a bank is created. In order to avoid large memcpys, we
      can use a CoW mechanism for certain fields.
   6. In a similar vein, some fields are very large and are not written
      to very often, and are only read at the epoch boundary. The most
      notable example is the stake delegations cache. In order to handle
      this, we can use a delta-based approach where each bank only has
      a delta of the stake delegations. The root bank will own the full
      set of stake delegations. This means that the deltas are only
      applied to the root bank as each bank gets rooted. If the caller
      needs to access the full set of stake delegations for a given
      bank, they can assemble the full set of stake delegations by
      applying all of the deltas from the current bank and all of its
      ancestors up to the root bank.

  Each field of a fd_bank_t has a pre-specified set of fields including
    - name: the name of the field
    - footprint: the size of the field in bytes
    - align: the alignment of the field
    - CoW: whether the field is CoW
    - has_lock: whether the field has a rw-lock
    - type: type of the field

  fd_banks_t is represented by a left-child, right-sibling n-ary tree
  (inspired by fd_ghost) to keep track of the parent-child fork tree.
  The underlying data structure is a map of fd_bank_t structs that is
  keyed by block id. This map is backed by a simple memory pool.

  NOTE: The reason fd_banks_t is keyed by block id and not by slot is
  to handle block equivocation: if there are two different blocks for
  the same slot, we need to be able to differentiate and handle both
  blocks against different banks.

  Each field in fd_bank_t that is not CoW is laid out contiguously in
  the fd_bank_t struct as simple uchar buffers. This allows for a simple
  memcpy to clone the bank state from a parent to a child.

  Each field that is CoW has its own memory pool. The memory
  corresponding to the field is not located in the fd_bank_t struct and
  is instead represented by a pool index and a dirty flag. If the field
  is modified, then the dirty flag is set, and an element of the pool
  is acquired and the data is copied over from the parent pool idx.

  Currently, there is a delta-based field, fd_stake_delegations_t.
  Each bank stores a delta-based representation in the form of an
  aligned uchar buffer. The full state is stored in fd_banks_t also as
  a uchar buffer which corresponds to the full state of stake
  delegations for the current root. fd_banks_t also reserves another
  buffer which can store the full state of the stake delegations.

  fd_bank_t also holds all of the rw-locks for the fields that have
  rw-locks.

  So, when a bank is cloned from a parent, the non CoW fields are copied
  over and the CoW fields just copy over a pool index. The CoW behavior
  is completely abstracted away from the caller as callers have to
  query/modify fields using specific APIs.

  The memory for the banks is based off of two bounds:
  1. the max number of unrooted blocks at any given time. Most fields
     can be bounded by this value.
  2. the max number of forks that execute through any 1 block.  We bound
     fields that are only written to at the epoch boundary by
     the max fork width that can execute through the boundary instead of
     by the max number of banks.  See fd_banks_footprint() for more
     details.

  NOTE: An important invariant is that if a field is CoW, then it must
  have a rw-lock.

  NOTE: Another important invariant is that if a field is limiting its
  fork width, then it must be CoW.

  The usage pattern is as follows:

   To create an initial bank:
   fd_bank_t * bank_init = fd_bank_init_bank( banks, block_id );

   To clone bank from parent banks:
   fd_bank_t * bank_clone = fd_banks_clone_from_parent( banks, block_id, parent_block_id );

   To publish a bank (aka update the root bank):
   fd_bank_t * bank_publish = fd_banks_publish( banks, block_id );

   To query some arbitrary bank:
   fd_bank_t * bank_query = fd_banks_get_bank( banks, block_id );

  To access fields in the bank if a field does not have a lock:

  fd_struct_t const * field = fd_bank_field_query( bank );
  OR
  fd_struct field = fd_bank_field_get( bank );

  To modify fields in the bank if a field does not have a lock:

  fd_struct_t * field = fd_bank_field_modify( bank );
  OR
  fd_bank_field_set( bank, value );

  To access fields in the bank if the field has a lock:

  fd_struct_t const * field = fd_bank_field_locking_query( bank );
  ... use field ...
  fd_bank_field_locking_end_query( bank );

  To modify fields in the bank if the field has a lock:

  fd_struct_t * field = fd_bank_field_locking_modify( bank );
  ... use field ...
  fd_bank_field_locking_end_locking_modify( bank );

  IMPORTANT SAFETY NOTE: fd_banks_t assumes that there is only one bank
  being executed against at a time. However, it is safe to call
  fd_banks_publish while threads are executing against a bank.
