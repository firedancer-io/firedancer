   Rationale for block_map parameters:
    - each lock manages block_max / lock_cnt elements, so with block_max
      at 4096, each lock would manage 4 contiguous elements.
    - Since keys are unique and increment by 1, we can index key to map
      bucket by taking key % ele_max directly. This way in theory we
      have perfect hashing and never need to probe.
       - This breaks when we store more than 4096 contiguous slots,
         i.e.: slot 0 collides with slot 4096, but this is at heart an
         OOM issue.
    - Causes possible contention - consider if we execute n, but are
      storing shreds for n+1 -- these are managed by the same lock.
      Perhaps opportunity for optimization.

   With the parallelization of the shred map and block map, parts of the

   have their own locks, which are managed through the
   query_try/query_test APIs. When accessing buf_shred_t and
   block_info_t items then, the caller does not need to use
   blockstore_start/end_read/write. However, the
   blockstore_start/end_read/write still protects the blockstore_shmem_t
   object. If you are reading and writing any blockstore_shmem fields
   and at the same time accessing the block_info_t or buf_shred_t, you
   should call both the blockstore_start/end_read/write APIs AND the map
   query_try/test APIs. These are locks of separate concerns and will
   not deadlock with each other. TODO update docs when we switch to

/* IMPORTANT! NOTES FOR block_map USAGE:

   The block_info entries must be queried using the query_try/query_test
   pattern. This will frequently look like:

   int err = FD_MAP_ERR_AGAIN;
   loop while( err == FD_MAP_ERR_AGAIN )
      block_map_query_t query;
      err = fd_block_map_query_try( nonblocking );
      block_info_t * ele = fd_block_map_query_ele(query);
      if ERROR is FD_MAP_ERR_KEY, then the slot is not found.
      if ERROR is FD_MAP_ERR_AGAIN, then immediately continue.
         // important to handle ALL possible return err codes *before*
         // accessing the ele, as the ele will be the sentinel (usually NULL)
      speculatively execute <stuff>
         - no side effects
         - no early return
      err = fd_block_map_query_test(query)
   end loop

   Some accessors are provided to callers that already do this pattern,
   and handle the looping querying. For example, block_hash_copy, and
   parent_slot_query. However, for most caller use cases, it would be
   much more effecient to use the query_try/query_test pattern directly.

   Example: if you are accessing a block_info_t m, and m->parent_slot to
   the blockstore->shmem->smr, then you will need to start_write on the
   blockstore, query_try for the block_info_t object, set
   shmem->smr = meta->parent_slot, and then query_test, AND call
   blockstore_end_write. In the case that there's block_info contention,
   i.e. another thread is removing the block_info_t object of interest
   as we are trying to access it, the query_test will ERR_AGAIN, we will
   loop back and try again, hit the FD_MAP_ERR_KEY condition
   (and exit the loop gracefully), and we will have an incorrectly set
   shmem->smr.

   So depending on the complexity of what's being executed, it's easiest
   to directly copy what you need from the block_info_t into a variable
   outside the context of the loop, and use it further below, ex:

   ulong map_item = NULL_ITEM;
   loop {
     query_try
     map_item = ele->map_item; // like parent_slot
     query_test
   }
   check if map_item is NULL_ITEM
   fd_blockstore_start_write
   use map_item
   fd_blockstore_end_write

   Writes and updates (blocking). The pattern is:
   int err = fd_block_map_prepare( &slot, query, blocking );
   block_info_t * ele = fd_block_map_query_ele(query);

   IF slot was an existing key, then ele->slot == slot, and you are MODIFYING
      <modify ele>
   If slot was not an existing key, then ele->slot == 0, and you are INSERTING
      ele->slot = slot;
      <initialize ele>
