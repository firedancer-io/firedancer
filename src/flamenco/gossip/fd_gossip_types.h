/* A contact info represents a peer node in the cluster that is
   publishing information about itself to the gossip network.  It it
   sent when the tag is FD_GOSSIP_UPDATE_TAG_CONTACT_INFO.

   Contact infos are already deduplicated, so the same pubkey will not
   appear twice, and the number of contact infos outstanding is limited
   to FD_CONTACT_INFO_TABLE_SIZE.  If more contact infos are received,
   the oldest ones are first removed with a
   FD_GOSSIP_UPDATE_TAG_CONTACT_INFO_REMOVE fragment.

   Contact infos are regularly updated, for example if a node changes
   its IP address or port.  More typically nodes just periodically
   republish their contact info with an updated wallclock.  When an
   existing contact info is updated, a FD_GOSSIP_UPDATE_TAG_CONTACT_INFO
   fragment is sent with the same pubkey.

   Contact information is not well-validated by the gossip network, and
   for example the wallclock may be old, or in the future, and the
   sockets may be unroutable or invalid (a private network), and the
   version fields are completely arbitrary.

   However, the pubkey is authenticated, as messages are signed.
