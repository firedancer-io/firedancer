/* TODO: When we get a pull request, respond with ContactInfos first if
   we have any available that are responsive. */

/* The Solana gossip protocol is used so that distributed nodes can
   share key-value pairs and reach an eventually consistent consensus on
   what's in the key-value store.

   It is peer to peer, and proceeds with these key pieces:

    - To join the cluster, a node must first contact a known node
      (an entrypoint) and register itself, by sending its own contact
      information key-value pair.  Contact information is the UDP
      address and port.

    - The cluster will then agree on that key-value pair, and start
      broadcasting updates to the node.

    - Each node must periodically send new messages it has received to
      a (somewhat) random selection of peers (referred to as the active
      set).

    - In addition, each node can periodically send a "pull request" to
      a random selection of peers, asking them to send any messages
      they have that the node does not.  This is used to ensure that
      nodes are eventually consistent in case they miss some pushed
      messages.  Bloom filters are used to track which messages have
      been received, and to avoid sending duplicates.

    - Each node can also send prune messages to peers, asking them
      to stop forwarding (pushing) messages from a particular origin.
      This is used to avoid receiving too many duplicate messages from
      the same origin.

    - Nodes with stake are always considered part of the network, but
      low staked nodes need to maintain a connection by responding to
      ping messages.  These pings are to prevent DDoS attacks which
      reflect off gossip nodes.

   Other than this, everything else is implementation details.  For
   specifics on the network and wire protocol, see https://github.com/eigerco/solana-spec/blob/main/gossip-protocol-spec.md
   and for more details on the Agave implementation, see https://github.com/eigerco/solana-spec/blob/main/implementation-details.md

   The Solana gossip protocol is heavily based on Plum Tree, see
   https://www.dpss.inesc-id.pt/~ler/reports/srds07.pdf for details. */
