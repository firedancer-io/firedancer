#define FD_STAKE_DELEGATIONS_MAGIC (0xF17EDA2CE757A3E0) /* FIREDANCER STAKE V0 */

/* fd_stakes_delegations_t is a cache of stake accounts mapping the
   pubkey of the stake account to various information including
   stake, activation/deactivation epoch, corresponding vote_account,
   credits observed, and warmup cooldown rate. This is used to quickly
   iterate through all of the stake delegations in the system during
   epoch boundary reward calculations.

   The implementation of fd_stakes_delegations_t is a hash map which
   is backed by a memory pool. Callers are allowed to insert, replace,
   and remove entries from the map.

   fd_stakes_delegations_t can also exist in two modes: with and without
   tombstones. The mode is determined by the leave_tombstones flag
   passed to fd_stake_delegations_new. If tombstones are enabled, then
   calling fd_stake_delegations_remove will not remove the entry from
   the map, but rather set the is_tombstone flag to true. This is
   useful for delta updates where we want to keep the entry in the map
   for future reference. In practice, this struct is used in both modes
   by the bank. The stake delegations corresponding to each slot are
   stored in a delta struct which is used to update the main cache.

   There are some important invariants wrt fd_stake_delegations_t:
   1. After execution has started, there will be no invalid stake
      accounts in the stake delegations struct.
   2. The stake delegations struct can have valid delegations for vote
      accounts which no longer exist.
   3. There are no stake accounts which are valid delegations which
      exist in the accounts database but not in fd_stake_delegations_t.

   In practice, fd_stakes_delegations_t are updated in 3 cases:
   1. During bootup when the snapshot manifest is loaded in. The cache
      is also refreshed during the bootup process to ensure that the
      states are valid and up-to-date.

      The reason we can't populate the stake accounts from the cache
      is because the cache in the manifest is partially incomplete:
      all of the expected keys are there, but the values are not.
      Notably, the credits_observed field is not available until all of
      the accounts are loaded into the database.

      https://github.com/anza-xyz/agave/blob/v2.3.6/runtime/src/bank.rs#L1780-L1806

   2. After transaction execution. If an update is made to a stake
      account, the updated state is reflected in the cache (or the entry
      is evicted).
   3. During rewards distribution. Stake accounts are partitioned over
      several hundred slots where their rewards are distributed. In this
      case, the cache is updated to reflect each stake account post
      reward distribution.
   The stake accounts are read-only during the epoch boundary. */

/* The max number of stake accounts that can be modified in a current
   slot from transactions can be bounded based on CU consumption. The
   best strategy to maximize the max number of stake accounts modified
   in a single transaction.  A stake program instruction can either
   modify one or two stake accounts.  Stake program instructions that
   modify two stake accounts (merge/split) are assumed to be at least 2x
   as expensive as a stake program instruction that modifies one stake
   account.  So we will assume that the most efficient strategy is to
   modify one stake account per instruction and have as many instruction
   as posssible in this transaction.  We can have 63 stake program
   instructions in this transaction because one account will be the fee
   payer/signature and the other 63 are free to be writable accounts.

   Given the above:
   100000000 - CUs per slot
   64 - Max number of writable accounts per transaction.
   63 - Max number of writable stake accounts per transaction.
   720 - Cost of a signature
   300 - Cost of a writable account lock.
   6000 - Cost of a stake program instruction.

   We can have (100000000 / (720 + 300 * 64 + 6000 * 63)) = 251
   optimal stake program transactions per slot.  With 63 stake accounts
   per transaction, we can have 251 * 63 = 15813 stake accounts modified
   in a slot. */
