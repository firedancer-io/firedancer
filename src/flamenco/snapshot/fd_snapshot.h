/* fd_snapshot_load_all does a blocking load of a snapshot. It is a wrapper
   around fd_snapshot_load_new, fd_snapshot_load_init, 
   fd_snapshot_load_manifest_and_status_cache, and fd_snapshot_load_fini.

   fd_snapshot_load_new sets up the context that is passed around for the
   other fd_snapshot_load_* functions.

   fd_snapshot_load_init starts the process of loading in the snapshot and
   sets up the funk transactions, etc..

   fd_snapshot_load_manifest_and_status_cache loads in the manifest and the
   status cache exiting as soon as the manifest is loaded in.

   fd_snapshot_load_accounts will load in the rest of the snapshot file but
   the runtime is still not setup to run.

   fd_snapshot_load_fini will use the slot context and funk which are now
   populated to setup the runtime and finalize the snapshot load.

   The reason these are broken out is to support loading in the manifest as 
   quickly as possible, allowing for other operations to start (like 
   stake-weighted repair) while the rest of the snapshot is being loaded. This
   is needed as loading in the manifest only takes a few seconds and the overall
   time to load in a snapshot is dominated by loading in the append vecs.

   source_cstr is either a local file system path.
   TODO: Add support for an HTTP url.

   slot_ctx is a valid initialized slot context (a funk, acc_mgr, heap
   valloc, zero-initialized slot bank).

   slot_ctx->valloc should have enough space to buffer the snapshot's
   manifest.

   If verify_hash!=0 calculates the snapshot hash.

   If check_hash!=0 checks that the snapshot hash matches the file name.

   snapshot_type is one of FD_SNAPSHOT_TYPE_{...}. */
