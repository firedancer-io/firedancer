/* fd_xdp_install installs a BPF program onto the given interface which
   only passes through UDP traffic on the provided ports to rings on an
   XSK map.  The XSK map is created and returned in the fd_xdp_fds_t,
   along with a bpf link file descriptor (from BPF_LINK_CREATE).  This
   link must not be closed or the XDP program will be uninstalled from
   the device, and no more packets will be received.  This happens
   automatically when the process exits.

   The XSK map returned in xsk_map_fd simply needs to have socket file
   descriptors inserted, one per each queue, with BPF_MAP_UPDATE_ELEM,
   where the sockets are correctly configured XSK sockets.

   This function will print a diagnostic error message and terminate the
   process if it fails, and will not return in failure cases. */
