/* fd_neigh4_probe.h is a hack to indirectly trigger ARP requests in
   Linux.

   ### Background

   When sending an IP packet via the Firedancer network stack, it is
   the net tile's responsibility to pick the network interface to send
   the packet out on, as well as the destination MAC address.

   The dst MAC address is taken from a neighbor table entry given the
   "next hop" (an output of a previously done route table lookiup).
   The neighbor table is directly mirrored from the Linux kernel.

   If no matching neighbor table entry exists, the system should send
   broadcast an ARP request (e.g. "who is 192.168.12.13? tell
   192.168.12.4").  ARP relies to this request will then go to the
   kernel.  The kernel also needs to be told that it should expect an
   ARP reply to avoid drops.

   ### Possible Solutions

   1. Add a neighbor table entry, send out the ARP request via XDP:
      `ip neigh add IP_ADDR nud incomplete`
      Requires CAP_NET_ADMIN (to send RTM_NEWNEIGH)

   2. Add a neighbor table entry, make the kernel increase the ARP
      request: `ip neigh add IP_ADDR nud incomplete use`
      Requires CAP_NET_ADMIN (to send RTM_NEWNEIGH)

   3. Send a UDP datagram, which indirectly makes the kernel do an ARP
      request: `echo "hello" | nc -u IP_ADDR:65535`
      Does not require privileges

   4. Send an IP packet (ICMP echo, invalid ICMP, invalid next proto...)
      `ping IP_ADDR -c 1`
      Requires CAP_NET_RAW to create a SOCK_RAW socket

   Solution 2 is theoretically ideal.  Unfortunately, it requires the
   netlink API caller to be in the root user namespace, which would
   break assumptions made in fd_sandbox.

   fd_neigh4_probe implements solution 3 because it requires the least
   amount of privileges. */
