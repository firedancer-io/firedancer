/* FEC chainer is an API for "chaining" FEC sets as they are received
   asynchronously out-of-order over the network (via Turbine and
   Repair).  The chainer both validates and reorders those FEC sets, and
   delivers them in-order to the calling application.

   Every FEC set has a parent (the immediately preceding FEC set in the
   slot or parent slot) and children (immediately succeeding FEC set(s)
   for the same slot or child slots).  Because of forks, FEC sets can
   have multiple children, but this will only be true across slots (ie.
   the parent and child must be different slots).  The chainer treats
   forks as "concurrent" with no particular order, so the calling
   application will receive forking FEC sets in the order in which the
   chainer is able to chain them.

   There is a protocol violation called equivocation (also known as
   "duplicates") that breaks the invariant that forks must be across
   slots.  For example, equivocation can result in observing two or more
   child FEC sets for a given parent FEC set in the same slot.
   Equivocation can also result in other anomalies such as keying
   collisions (this is detailed later in the documentation).  The
   chainer makes a best-effort attempt to detect and error on
   equivocation. Examples include checking merkle roots chain correctly
   and checking FEC sets are unique.  Not all cases of equivocation can
   be detected by the chainer however, as not all the necessary
   information is yet available at this stage in the validator pipeline.
   Ultimately, if there is equivocation, it is the responsibility of the
   consensus module to handle it. */

/* fd_fec_chainer is a tree-like structure backed by three maps.  At any
   given point in time, an element (FEC set) in the chainer is in one of
   three possible positions with respect to the tree: a non-leaf, leaf,
   or not connected.  This corresponds to the ancestry, frontier, or
   orphaned maps, respectively.  Therefore, a given element will always
   be present in exactly one of these maps, depending on where (and
   whether) it currently is in the tree.

   KEYING

   The chainer keys FEC sets by concatenating the slot with fec_set_idx.
   This uniquely identifies a FEC set in most cases.  It is possible to
   receive over the network two or more different FEC sets with the same
   slot and fec_set_idx due to equivocation as mentioned earlier.  In
   general, the chainer expects the caller to handle equivocation and
   assumes unique FEC sets will have unique keys (handholding is
   available to verify this).

   The map key is an encoding of the slot and fec_set_idx which uniquely
   keys every FEC set.  The 32 msb of the key are the 32 lsb of the slot
   and the 32 lsb of the key are the fec_set_idx, except when the FEC
   set is the last one for the slot, in which case the 32 lsb are set to
   UINT_MAX. By setting fec_set_idx to UINT_MAX, the chainer can easily
   query for the last FEC set in any given slot

   A useful property of the keying scheme above is a FEC set can infer
   the key of its immediate child by adding data_cnt to its fec_set_idx.
   For example, a FEC set for slot 0, fec_set_idx 0, data_cnt 32 knows
   its child key is slot 0, fec_set_idx 32. The last FEC set in the slot
   is special because the child(s) FEC set will have a different slot
   number, so we know the fec_set_idx will be zero.

   There is one exception to this keying scheme.  When the FEC set is
   the last one in the slot, an extra insertion to the parent_map is
   done. In the standard procedure, the second to last fec will create
   the (n-1, n) entry, and the following child slot will create a
   (UINT_MAX, 0) entry. Thus we insert an extra entry (n, UINT_MAX) in
   the parent_map to connect the chain. This double insertion is only
   done for the parent_map - the pool_ele will have an element with key
   slot | fec_set_idx, not UINT_MAX.

   Visually, the parent_map / elements looks like this:

      - Arrows denote a child->parent entry in the parent_map.

   parent_map                                             |  pool_ele (slot, fec_set_idx, completes)

                  (slot + 1, 32)                          |  (slot + 1, 32, 0)
                        ▲                                 |
                        |                                 |
                  (slot + 1, 64) ◄── (slot + 1, UINT_MAX) |  (slot + 1, 64, 1)
                        ▲                                 |
                        | ...                             |

   Thus we will have double entries for the last FEC set in a slot in
   the parent map, but only one entry in the ancestry/orphan/frontier
   pool. This means if we want to query for the last FEC set in a slot,
   we need to query the parent_map twice - once with the fec_set_idx set
   to UINT_MAX and once with the parent_key of the result.

   INSERTING

   When inserting a new FEC set, the chainer first checks whether the
   parent is a FEC set already in the frontier map.  This indicates that
   the new FEC set directly chains off the frontier.  If it does, the
   parent FEC set is removed, and the new FEC set is inserted into the
   frontier map.  This is the common case because we expect FEC sets to
   chain linearly the vast majority (ie. not start new forks), so the
   new FEC set is simply "advancing" the frontier.  The parent FEC set
   is also added to the ancestry map, so that every leaf can trace back
   to the root.

   If the FEC set's parent is not already in the frontier, the chainer
   checks the ancestry map next.  If the parent is in the ancestry map,
   the chainer knows that this FEC set is starting a new fork, because
   it is part of the tree (the ancestry) but not one of the leaves (the
   frontier).  In this case, the new FEC set is simply inserted into the
   frontier map, and now the frontier has an additional fork (leaf).

   Lastly, if the FEC set's parent is not in the ancestry map, the
   chainer knows that this FEC set is orphaned.  It is inserted into the
   orphaned map for later retry of tree insertion when its ancestors
   have been inserted.

   Here are some more important details on forks. Note a FEC set can
   only start a new fork when it is across a slot boundary (different
   slot than its parent).  It is invalid for two FEC sets to chain off
   the same parent FEC within the same slot - this would imply there are
   two FECs keyed by the (same slot, fec_set_idx) combination, which as
   detailed earlier, is equivocation.  Therefore, only the first FEC set
   in a slot can start a fork from the last FEC set in a parent slot. We
   know a FEC set is the first one in a slot when the fec_set_idx is 0,
   and we know it is the last one when the last shred in the FEC set has
   the SLOT_COMPLETE flag set.

   QUERYING

   The chainer can fast O(1) query any FEC set using the key.  As
   mentioned earlier, any FEC set except the last one in a slot can
   derive its direct child's key and therefore query for it.

   For the special case of the first FEC set in a slot, the chainer can
   derive the parent key by subtracting the parent_off from the slot and
   querying for (slot, UINT_MAX).

   CHAINING

   As mentioned in the top-level documentation, the purpose of the
   chainer is to chain FEC sets.  On insertion, the chainer will attempt
   to chain as many FEC sets as possible to the frontier.  The chainer
   does this by conducting a BFS from the just-inserted FEC set, looking
   for parents and orphans to traverse.  See `chain` in the .c file for
   the implementation. */
