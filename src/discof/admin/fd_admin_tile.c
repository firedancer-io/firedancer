/* The process of switching identity of the validator is somewhat

   a block where half the shreds are signed by one private key, and half
   are signed by another).

   The process of switching is a state machine that progresses linearly
   through each of the states.  Generally, no transitions are allowed
   except direct forward steps, except in emergency recovery cases an
   operator can force the state past the initial lock.

   The states follow, in order. */

/* State 0: UNLOCKED.
     The validator is not currently in the process of switching keys. */
#define FD_SET_IDENTITY_STATE_UNLOCKED                (0UL)

/* State 1: LOCKED
     Some client to the validator has requested a key switch.  To do so,
     it acquired an exclusive lock on the validator to prevent the
     switch potentially being interleaved with another client. */
#define FD_SET_IDENTITY_STATE_LOCKED                  (1UL)

/* State 2: LEADER_HALT_REQUESTED
     The first step in the key switch process is to pause the leader
     pipeline of the validator, preventing us from becoming leader, but
     finishing any currently in progress leader slot if there is one.
     While in this state, the validator is waiting for the leader
     pipeline to confirm that it has paused production, and is no longer
     leader.

     In Firedancer, this halt request goes to the Replay tile, which
     causes the tile to switch the identity key it uses to determine the
     identity's balance as well as when the validator is the leader.
     After the leader pipeline has been halted, the validator will no
     longer become a leader until the switch has been completed. */
#define FD_SET_IDENTITY_STATE_LEADER_HALT_REQUESTED   (2UL)

/* State 3: LEADER_HALTED
     The Replay tile has confirmed that it has halted the leader
     pipeline, and the validator is no longer leader.  No more blocks
     will be produced until it is unhalted.  In addition, the Replay
     tile has switched its own identity key.

     At this point, we also have the guarantee that there are no more
     outstanding shreds that have to be signed with the old key.  Any
     tiles related to the leader pipeline that rely on the identity key
     will not be used. */
#define FD_SET_IDENTITY_STATE_LEADER_HALTED           (3UL)

/* State 4: REPLAY_HALT_REQUESTED
     Repair, Gossip, and Tower tiles will stop sending requests
     downstream to the sign tile.  This is done to avoid any mismatches
     with the identity key.  Their identity keys will be switched after
     this step.  These tiles all use the identity key to make forward
     progress on non-leader pipeline replay.

     These tiles use the identity key to populate messages which are
     signed by the sign tile:
       (a) Repair.  The repair tile uses the identity key as part of the
           repair protocol.  The identity key is included in and used
           for signing requests.  Because Repair uses an asynchronous
           signing mechanism, Repair will first wait until all
           outstanding sign requests have been received back from the
           sign tile before halting any new signing requests.
       (b) Gossip.  The gossip tile sends out ContactInfo messages with
           our identity key, and also uses the identity key to sign
           outgoing gossip messages.
       (c) Tower.  The tower tiles uses the identity key to generate
           vote transactions which are sent to the send tile.  These
           vote transactions are then signed downstream by the TxSend
           tile instead of having its own keyguard client. */
#define FD_SET_IDENTITY_STATE_REPLAY_HALT_REQUESTED   (4UL)

/* State 5: REPLAY_HALTED
     Repair, Gossip, and Tower are no longer sending requests to the
     sign tile.  Replay can keep progressing at this point. However,
     the tower tile may have an in-flight vote transaction to the TxSend
     tile that corresponds to the old identity key. */
#define FD_SET_IDENTITY_STATE_REPLAY_HALTED           (5UL)

/* State 6: TXSEND_FLUSH_REQUESTED
     Once the Tower tile has updated its identity key and stopped
     sending vote transactions to the TxSend tile, any in-flight vote
     transactions for the old identity key must be flushed to avoid
     being badly signed.  We also know that Tower will send no more
     vote transactions to the TxSend tile.

     The TxSend tile is flushed by telling it the last sequence number
     the Tower tile has produced for an outgoing vote transaction at the
     time it was halted.  Once the TxSend tile has processed all vote
     transactions up to and including that sequence number, it will
     switch its own identity key.  There is a guarantee that the TxSend
     tile will not request to sign any vote transactions until it is
     unhalted.  At this point, the TxSend tile will stop receiving any
     new frags from the Net tile.  The reason for this is to avoid any
     QUIC callbacks that invoke key signing. */
#define FD_SET_IDENTITY_STATE_TXSEND_FLUSH_REQUESTED  (6UL)

/* State 7: TXSEND_FLUSHED
     The TxSend tile confirms that it has seen and processed all votes
     up to and including the last sequence number produced by the Tower
     tile at the time it was halted.  The TxSend tile also switches its
     own identity key which is used for signing votes and establishing
     a QUIC connection.  The TxSend tile is now no longer receiving any
     new frags from the Net tile. */
#define FD_SET_IDENTITY_STATE_TXSEND_FLUSHED          (7UL)

/* State 8: ALL_SWITCH_REQUESTED
     The client now requests that all other tiles which consume the
     identity key in some way switch to the new key.  The leader
     pipeline is still halted, although it doesn't strictly need to be,
     since outgoing shreds have been flushed.  This is done to keep the
     control flow simpler.  The sign tile is switched first to avoid any
     potential mismatches with the identity key.

     The other tiles using the identity key are:
       (a) Sign.  The sign tile is responsible for holding the private
           key and servicing signing requests from other tiles.
       (b) GUI.  The GUI shows the validator identity key to the user,
           and uses the key to determine which blocks are ours for
           highlighting on the frontend.
       (c) Bundle.  The validator must authenticate to any connected
           bundle server with the identity key to prove it is on the
           leader schedule.
       (d) Gossvf.  The gossvf tile uses the identity key to detect
           duplicate running instances of the same validator node as
           well as other message handling.
       (e) Shred.  The shred tile uses the identity key to determine the
           position of the validator in the Turbine tree and to sign
           outgoing shreds.
       (f) Event.  Outgoing events to the event server are signed with
           the identity key to authenticate the sender. */
