/* fd_rdisp defines methods for building a DAG (directed acyclic graph)
   of transactions, and executing them in the appropriate order with the
   maximum amount of parallelism.

   Transactions must appear to execute in the order in which they occur
   in the block (the "serial fiction").  However, when two transactions
   are independent, they can actually be scheduled in either order, or
   in parallel.  Two transactions are independent unless one writes to
   an account that the other reads or writes.  If two transactions are
   not independent, the one that comes earlier in the block is a
   predecessor transaction of the one that comes later in the block.  In
   order to ensure correct execution, a transaction cannot be executed
   until all its predecessor transactions have completed.  In this file,
   a transaction completing means that the results of its account writes
   will be visible to a subsequent transaction executing on any core.

   Shockingly, this dispatcher does not need to keep a copy of
   transactions (more on this later), which means it operates almost
   entirely on transaction indices.  An index is a positive integer
   (uint) up to some maximum.  The 0 index is a sentinel, and doesn't
   correspond to a real transaction.  It's up to the caller to maintain
   the mapping between each transaction index and the transaction itself.

   A transaction index is in one of the following states:
     * FREE, which means it doesn't correspond to a transaction
     * PENDING, which means it corresponds to a transaction that can't
       be scheduled yet because it must come after transactions that
       have not completed yet.
     * READY, which means all predecessor transactions have completed,
       but this transaction index has not been returned by
       get_next_ready yet
     * DISPATCHED, which means this transaction index was returned by
       get_next_ready but has not been completed yet.


                        --------------> PENDING
                add_txn |                  |
         FREE  ---------|                  |
          ^             |                  V    get_next_ready
          |             -------------->  READY ----------------
          |                                                   |
          |                                                   |
          |                                                   |
          |                  complete_txn                     V
          ---------------------------------------------- DISPATCHED


   Additionally, fd_rdisp is block-aware, and even somewhat fork-aware.
   Prior to inserting a transaction, a block must be added.  Then, when
   a transaction is inserted, the caller must specify the block it is
   part of.

   At all times, each block is either STAGED or UNSTAGED.  Blocks that
   are STAGED benefit from the full parallelization-maximizing dispatch,
   but at most four linear chains of blocks can be STAGED at any time.
   Assuming the limit of four is still satisfied, when a block is added,
   it may be added as STAGED.  Otherwise, if it's added as UNSTAGED, it
   may be promoted to STAGED later, though this is worse for performance
   than adding it as STAGED initially.  Blocks may be demoted from
   STAGED to UNSTAGED only if the linear chain doesn't contain any
   PENDING, READY, or DISPATCHED transactions.

   Prior to properly introducing staging lanes, we need to introduce two
   more concepts.  A block can be insert-ready, schedule-ready, neither,
   or both.  A block must be insert-ready to call fd_rdisp_add_txn on
   it; a block must be schedule-ready to call get_next_ready on it.
   Various functions either require or modify these properties of a
   block.  These properties are necessary but not sufficient for the
   respective functions to succeed; for example, a block may be
   schedule-ready but empty, in which case, scheduling will still not
   succeed.  An UNSTAGED block is always both insert-ready and
   schedule-ready.

   A staging lane can contain a single block or a sequence of blocks.
   When a staging lane contains more than one block, some restrictions
   apply, namely, only the first block in the sequence is
   schedule-ready, and only the last block in the sequence is
   insert-ready, where first and last are determined by the order in
   which the block is staged.  Although this restriction makes the
   interface a bit more complicated, it's driven by performance
   requirements and common use cases.  Basically, there's no use for
   being able to replay a block before we've replayed its parent block.

   Basically, rdisp is designed to handle three situations well:
    * The normal case, where replay is pretty much caught up, and there
      are only one or two forks, containing only one or two un-replayed
      blocks each.
    * The startup case, where repair is far ahead of replay, but there's
      only a single fork, or very few forks
    * The DoS case, where there are many forks, perhaps duplicate
      blocks, and we don't know which to prioritize yet, but we will
      execute some, and prune the rest later.  This includes the case
      where we stop receiving transactions from some of the forks but
      don't know that the block has ended.

   In the normal case, there are few enough unreplayed blocks that it
   doesn't really matter how the staging lanes are used.  For the
   startup case, the long linear chains of blocks can all be STAGED using
   the same lane with no performance degradation.  In the DoS case, most
   of the forks will be UNSTAGED, and using some combination of
   replaying, cancelling, and demoting blocks, staging lanes can be freed
   up so that the canonical chain can emerge.

   Consider the following example of storing a fork tree in staging
   lanes:
    - Slot 10's parent is not specified
    - Slot 11's parent is slot 10
    - Slot 13's parent is slot 11
    - Slot 14's parent is also slot 11

   Since the caller chooses the staging lane, the caller may choose
   between
             Lane 0: 10 --> 11 --> 13
             Lane 1: 14
   and
             Lane 0: 10 --> 11 --> 14
             Lane 1: 13.
   or any of the various combinations that consume more staging lanes.
   Note that the concept of staging lanes is a performance optimization,
   not a safety feature.  With the first arrangment, the caller cannot
   call get_next_ready on slot 13 in between slots 10 and 11, but
   there's no issue with calling it on slot 14 then, which would
   obiously result in an incorrect replay.  It's ultimately the callers
   responsibility to ensure correct replay. */

/* fd_rdisp_add_txn adds a transaction to the block with tag

   added to this block in a prior call.

   insert_block must be a known block that is insert-ready.  txn,
   payload, and alts describe the transaction to be added.  txn must be
   the result of parsing payload, and alts contains the expansion and
   selection of the address lookup tables mentioned in the transaction
   (i.e. all the writable accounts followed by all the read-only
   accounts).  alts may be NULL, even if the transaction specifies that
   it loads accounts from an address lookup table; in this case,
   addresses from ALTs are ignored.

   Shockingly, this dispatcher does not retain any read interest (much
   less write interest) in the transaction (txn, payload, or alts).  On
   success, it returns a transaction index that was previously in the
   FREE state.  This API is designed to facilitate a model of use where
   the replay tile copies the incoming transaction to a region of
   private memory, adds it to this dispatcher, and then copies it (using
   non-temporal stores) to the output dcache at a location determined by
   the returned index.  Although there are two memcpys in this approach,
   it should result in fewer cache misses.

   If serializing is non-zero, this transaction will be a serialization
   point: all transactions added prior to this one must complete before
   this transaction can be scheduled, and this transaction must complete
   before any subsequently added transactions can be scheduled.  This is
   not good for performance, but is useful for the rare case when
   repair/turbine is several slots ahead of replay, and a transaction
   loads some accounts from an address lookup table, but we haven't
   executed the transaction to populate that part of the address lookup
   table yet.  This is the primary use for alts==NULL.

   Returns 0 and does not add the transaction on failure.  Fails if
   there were no free transaction indices, if the block with tag
   insert_block did not exist, or if it was not schedule-ready.
