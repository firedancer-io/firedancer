                          +----------+

   The state machine starts UNINIT, but once a snapshot is loaded it
   will transition to follower.

   The state machine is in a resting the state when FOLLOWER, in this
   state it knows a `next_leader_slot` and will continually hash to
   advance towards that slot.  When it reaches the `next_leader_slot`
   it will transition to the WAITING_FOR_BANK state, where it waits for
   the replay stage to tell it some information relevant to that leader
   slot, so that it can start doing mixins and hashing towards the end
   of the block.  When the block ends, the state transitions back to
   follower, even if the next slot is the leader, as we need the replay
   stage to tell us about the new leader slot.

   Sometimes it might happen that we have received the bank from replay
   stage before we have reached the `next_leader_slot`, in which case
   we transition to the WAITING_FOR_SLOT state, where we wait for the
   hash count to reach the leader slot.

   At any time, during any state except UNINIT, we can be suddenly
   "reset" by the replay tile.  Such reset actions may move the reset
   slot backwards or forwards, or set it back to something we have
   already seen before.  BUT, the `next_leader_slot` must always
   advance forward.

   If the PoH machine successfully completes a leader slot, by hashing
   it until the end, then the a completion message is sent back to
   replay with the final blockhash, after which the state machine enters
   the follower state once again, and waits for further instructions
   from replay. */

         (a) Ticks. These occur every 62,500 (hashcnt_per_tick) hashcnts,
             and there will be 64 (ticks_per_slot) of them in each slot.

             Ticks must not have any transactions mixed into the hash.
             This is not strictly needed in theory, but is required by the
             current consensus protocol.  They get published here in
             after_credit.

         (b) Microblocks.  These can occur at any other hashcnt, as long
             as it is not a tick.  Microblocks cannot be empty, and must
             have at least one transactions mixed in.  These get
             published in after_frag.

       If hashcnt_per_tick is 1, then we are in low power mode and the
       following does not apply, since we can mix in transactions at any
       time.

       In the normal, non-low-power mode, though, we have to be careful
       to make sure that we do not publish microblocks on tick
       boundaries.  To do that, we need to obey two rules:
         (i)  after_credit must not leave hashcnt one before a tick
              boundary
         (ii) if after_credit begins one before a tick boundary, it must
              advance hashcnt and publish the tick

       There's some interplay between min_hashcnt and restricted_hashcnt
       here, and we need to show that there's always a value of
       target_hashcnt we can pick such that
           min_hashcnt <= target_hashcnt <= restricted_hashcnt.
       We'll prove this by induction for current_slot==0 and
       is_leader==true, since all other slots should be the same.

       Let m_j and r_j be the min_hashcnt and restricted_hashcnt
       (respectively) for the jth call to after_credit in a slot.  We
       want to show that for all values of j, it's possible to pick a
       value h_j, the value of target_hashcnt for the jth call to
       after_credit (which is also the value of hashcnt after
       after_credit has completed) such that m_j<=h_j<=r_j.

       Additionally, let T be hashcnt_per_tick and N be ticks_per_slot.

       Starting with the base case, j==0.  m_j=0, and
         r_0 = N*T - max_microblocks_per_slot
                   - ceil(max_microblocks_per_slot/(T-1)).

       This is monotonic decreasing in max_microblocks_per_slot, so it
       achieves its minimum when max_microblocks_per_slot is its
       maximum.
           r_0 >= N*T - N*(T-1) - ceil( (N*(T-1))/(T-1))
                = N*T - N*(T-1)-N = 0.
       Thus, m_0 <= r_0, as desired.



       Then, for the inductive step, assume there exists h_j such that
       m_j<=h_j<=r_j, and we want to show that there exists h_{j+1},
       which is the same as showing m_{j+1}<=r_{j+1}.

       Let a_j be 1 if we had a microblock immediately following the jth
       call to after_credit, and 0 otherwise.  Then hashcnt at the start
       of the (j+1)th call to after_frag is h_j+a_j.
       Also, set b_{j+1}=1 if we are in the case covered by rule (ii)
       above during the (j+1)th call to after_credit, i.e. if
       (h_j+a_j)%T==T-1.  Thus, m_{j+1} = h_j + a_j + b_{j+1}.

       If we received an additional microblock, then
       max_remaining_microblocks goes down by 1, and
       max_remaining_ticks_or_microblocks goes down by either 1 or 2,
       which means restricted_hashcnt goes up by either 1 or 2.  In
       particular, it goes up by 2 if the new value of
       max_remaining_microblocks (at the start of the (j+1)th call to
       after_credit) is congruent to 0 mod T-1.  Let b'_{j+1} be 1 if
       this condition is met and 0 otherwise.  If we receive a
       done_packing message, restricted_hashcnt can go up by more, but
       we can ignore that case, since it is less restrictive.
       Thus, r_{j+1}=r_j+a_j+b'_{j+1}.

       If h_j < r_j (strictly less), then h_j+a_j < r_j+a_j.  And thus,
       since b_{j+1}<=b'_{j+1}+1, just by virtue of them both being
       binary,
             h_j + a_j + b_{j+1} <  r_j + a_j + b'_{j+1} + 1,
       which is the same (for integers) as
             h_j + a_j + b_{j+1} <= r_j + a_j + b'_{j+1},
                 m_{j+1}         <= r_{j+1}

       On the other hand, if h_j==r_j, this is easy unless b_{j+1}==1,
       which can also only happen if a_j==1.  Then (h_j+a_j)%T==T-1,
       which means there's an integer k such that

             h_j+a_j==(ticks_per_slot-k)*T-1
             h_j    ==ticks_per_slot*T -  k*(T-1)-1  - k-1
                    ==ticks_per_slot*T - (k*(T-1)+1) - ceil( (k*(T-1)+1)/(T-1) )

       Since h_j==r_j in this case, and
       r_j==(ticks_per_slot*T) - max_remaining_microblocks_j - ceil(max_remaining_microblocks_j/(T-1)),
       we can see that the value of max_remaining_microblocks at the
       start of the jth call to after_credit is k*(T-1)+1.  Again, since
       a_j==1, then the value of max_remaining_microblocks at the start
       of the j+1th call to after_credit decreases by 1 to k*(T-1),
       which means b'_{j+1}=1.

       Thus, h_j + a_j + b_{j+1} == r_j + a_j + b'_{j+1}, so, in
       particular, h_{j+1}<=r_{j+1} as desired. */

  /* The above proof showed that it was always possible to pick a value
     of target_hashcnt, but we still have a lot of freedom in how to
     pick it.  It simplifies the code a lot if we don't keep going after
     a tick in this function.  In particular, we want to publish at most
     1 tick in this call, since otherwise we could consume infinite
     credits to publish here.  The credits are set so that we should
     only ever publish one tick during this loop.  Also, all the extra
     stuff (leader transitions, publishing ticks, etc.) we have to do
     happens at tick boundaries, so this lets us consolidate all those
     cases.

     Mathematically, since the current value of hashcnt is h_j+a_j, the
     next tick (advancing a full tick if we're currently at a tick) is
     t_{j+1} = T*(floor( (h_j+a_j)/T )+1).  We need to show that if we set
     h'_{j+1} = min( h_{j+1}, t_{j+1} ), it is still valid.

     First, h'_{j+1} <= h_{j+1} <= r_{j+1}, so we're okay in that
     direction.

     Next, observe that t_{j+1}>=h_j + a_j + 1, and recall that b_{j+1}
     is 0 or 1. So then,
                    t_{j+1} >= h_j+a_j+b_{j+1} = m_{j+1}.

     We know h_{j+1) >= m_{j+1} from before, so then h'_{j+1} >=
