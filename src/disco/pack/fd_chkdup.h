/* fd_chkdup declares a set of functions for ultra-HPC checking if a
   list of account addresses contains any duplicates.  It's important
   that this be fast, because a transaction containing duplicate account
   addresses fails to sanitize and is not charged a fee.  Although this
   check can (and really ought) to be done in parallel, perhaps in the
   verify tiles, right now, it's done in pack, which means it's serial
   and on the critical path.

   On platforms with AVX, the current implementation uses a fast initial
   check which may have false positives (thinking there are duplicates
   when there aren't).  Any transaction that fails the initial check is
   then subjected to the full, precise check.  Without AVX, all
   transactions use the slow path. */

/* The functions are defined in the header to facilitate inlining since
   they take 10s of cycles in the good case, but should probably be
   treated as if they were defined in a .c file. */

   (list0 and list1) to facilitate 0-copy usage with address lookup

   chkdup is a pointer to a valid local join of a chkdup object.

   list0 and list1 point to the first account address of the respective

   fd_chkdup_check and the _slow version return 1 if the list of

   otherwise (implying each account address in the provided list is

   fd_chkdup_check_fast returns 1 if the list of transactions contains

   sometimes spuriiously return 1 even without duplicates.

   WARNING: the _fast version MAY HAVE FALSE POSITIVES.  You probably
   want the un-suffixed version, which is precise.  It uses the fast
   version as a fast-path and then does a slower full check if the
   fast-path suggests there may be a duplicate.

   However, it's also worth calling out again that the _fast version
   only makes errors in one direction.  If the list contains duplicates,
   it will definitely return 1.  If it returns 0, the list definitely
   does not contain duplicates. (Those two statements are equivalent).

/*   -----  Implementation details and discussion follow------

   The fast path implementation is somewhat interesting.  The normal way
   to do this is with a Bloom filter, but Bloom filters do lots of
   unpredictable reads and the pack tile is somewhat cache sensitive.
   Instead, this implements a variant on a Bloom filter that lives
   entirely in AVX registers.

   Basically, we use C W-bit words stored in (C*W)/256 AVX2 registers or
   (C*W)/512 AVX512 registers.  Each word is a modified Bloom filter
   with one associated hash function.  For each account address, we
   compute C hashes, giving (up to) C positions across the AVX
   registers.  If any of those positions have an unset bit, then we know
   we have not seen the account address before.  Finally, we then set
   all the positions.

   The only difference between this idea and a normal Bloom filter is
   that sometimes the hash function may not select a bit.  There's a
   tradeoff to be made here: suppose you insert R account addresses, and
   R is at least almost as large as W.  Then each word fills up, and
   false positives become increasingly likely.  Only testing and
   inserting a bit, say, half the time, effectively halves C, but
   prevents each word from getting saturated as quickly, and makes the
   algorithm effective for larger values of R.  We use Intel's quirky
   behavior to get this for free.

   (Note: The R and C notation is supposed to suggest a tabular layout
   in which the account addresses are rows and the words are columns.)

   The key insight into making this work quickly is that the vpsllv{d,q}
   variable left shift instructions are cheap (1 cycle, can execute on
   port 0 or 1 for AVX2, still 1 cycle on port 0 for AVX512).  If we can
   compute the hashes in parallel with SIMD, then we can variably shift
   bcast(0x1) quickly, and select several bits at a time.  The rest is
   just bitwise logic, which is extremely cheap with AVX.  This approach
   constrains W to be either 32 or 64, and C to be a multiple of the
   number of words in a vector, but those are both pretty acceptable
   constraints.

   The final ingredient is a cheap hash function that places the hashes
   in the appropriate position for vpsllv.  We just xor the account
   address with some validator-specific entropy and use a mask to select
   certain bits.

   The slow-path implementation uses a hash table to check for
   duplicates.  This is slower than sorting for transactions with only a
   few account addresses, but substantially faster than sorting for
   transactions with large numbers of account addresses, which is when
   the slow-path matters more anyway.


   You can see from above there are a variety of knobs to tune.  Should
   W be 32 or 64?  How big should C be?  How many bits should we mask
   off for the hash, which controls the frequency with which we skip a
   word, neither checking nor inserting a bit?  It would be good to have
   a rigorous understanding of the false positive rate as a function of
   these parameters so we can make a decision that minimizes the
   expected compute required.

   Unfortunately, the false positive computation is tricky.  The key
   difficulty is that whether processing account address r results in a
   false positive is not independent from whether processing account
   address r+1 results in a false positive.  This leads to an obnoxious
   inclusion-exclusion formula which quickly becomes more unwieldy than
   I (or Sage) can handle.

   A dynamic-programming-ish algorithm can compute the false positive
   rate in approximately O(R*2^R) time.  To start, we just want to
   understand a single word/column.  Suppose k bits in the word have
   been set.  Then there are (W-k) hash values that set a new bit, and
   (V+k) hash values that don't set a new, where V is the number of hash
   values that don't select a bit.  The hash values that set a bit are
   also exactly the ones that provide information that the account
   address is not a false positive.  I think about this as "spending a
   bit" to know it's not a false positive.

   Denoting the rows at which we spend a bit by a 1 and the rows at
   which we don't spend a bit by 0, we might get a column like:

                                1
                                0
                                1
                                1
                                0.
   The number of ways this column can occur is x1 =
   W*(V+1)*(W-1)*(W-2)*(V+3), which means that the probability the
   column occurs is x1/(W+V)^5.  Expanding to multiple columns is easy,
   since the number of ways that two specific columns can occur is just
   the product of the number of ways each can occur.  For example,
                              1 0
                              0 1
                              1 1
                              1 0
                              0 0
   can occur x1 * x2 ways, where x2 = V*W*(W-1)*(V+2)*(V+2).
   A false positive happens when there's a row of all 0s, as in the last
   row of the example.

   It's cleaner to count the number of ways not to get a false positive.
   This gives us the inclusion-exclusion formula:
   (all ways)
        - (all ways where row 0 is all 0s)
        - (all ways where row 1 is all 0s)
        - ...
        + (all ways where rows 0 and 1 are both all 0s)
        + (all ways where rows 0 and 2 are both all 0s)
        + ...
        - (all ways where rows 0, 1, and 2 are all 0s)
        - (all ways where rows 0, 1, and 3 are all 0s)
        +, - ...
        + (-1)^R (all ways in which all rows are all 0s).

   There's a nice way to understand each of these terms.  For example,
   in the R=2, C=3 case, the term in which row 0 is all 0s has the
   following elements:
    0 0 0   0 0 0   0 0 0   0 0 0   0 0 0   0 0 0   0 0 0   0 0 0
    0 0 0   0 0 1   0 1 0   0 1 1   1 0 0   1 0 1   1 1 0   1 1 1
   Rather than enumerating all 2^( (R-1)*C ) elements, we'll represent
   it as
                      ( 0  + 0 )^3
                      ( 0    1 )

   Skipping some steps, the task boils down to counting the number of
   ways to get columns that match a mask, then raising that to the Cth
   power.

   Now, with all this behind us, our goal is to pick the optimal value
   of W,V, and C given a supposed distribution of transactions, and a
   performance model.  Based on some back of the envelope calculations
   based on instruction throughput and latency measurements and
   confirmed by some experiments, the fast path code takes about 3.5*R
   cycles if using one AVX2 vector (W*C==256) and
   2.5*R+2*ceil(W*C/256)*R cycles otherwise.  The slow path takes about
   133*J cycles.  Then the expected value of the number of cycles it
   takes to process a transaction with R accounts is
     R*(2.5+2*ceil(W*C/256) - [W*C<=256]) + FP_{W,V,R,C}*133*R

   Based on a sample of 100,000 slots containing about 100M
   transactions, the CDF looks like

     Fraction of transactions containing <=  3 account addresses     71%
                                         <= 13 account addresses     80%
                                         <= 24 account addresses     91%
                                         <= 31 account addresses     95%
                                         <= 44 account addresses     98%
                                         <= 50 account addresses     99%

   Basically, there's a peak at 3 (votes), and then a very long, very
   fat tail.  When using AVX2, it basically boils down into 2 regimes:
          0 <= R <  28            W=32, C=8,  V=0  (one AVX vector)
         28 <= R <= 64            W=32, C=32, V=32 (four AVX vectors)

   This combination has an expected value of about 54 cycles over all
   transactions.  For a typical transaction with 3 account addresses,
   this takes about 10 cycles and the false positive probability is
   about 2e-10.

   When using AVX512, the regimes are similar:
          0 <= R <  36            W=32, C=16, V=0  (one AVX vector)
         36 <= R <= 64            W=32, C=32, V=32 (two AVX vectors)
  This combination has an expected value of about 33 cycles over all
  transactions.  Again, the typical 3 account address account takes
  about 9 cycles and has a negligible false positive probability. */
