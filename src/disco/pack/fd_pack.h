/* Each block is limited to 32k parity shreds.  We don't want pack to
   produce a block with so many transactions we can't shred it, but the
   correspondence between transactions and parity shreds is somewhat
   complicated, so we need to use conservative limits.

   Except for the final batch in the block, the current version of the
   shred tile shreds microblock batches of size (25431, 63671] bytes,
   including the microblock headers, but excluding the microblock count.
   The worst case size by bytes/parity shred is a 25871 byte microblock
   batch, which produces 31 parity shreds.  The final microblock batch,
   however, may be as bad as 48 bytes triggering the creation of 17
   parity shreds.  This gives us a limit of floor((32k - 17)/31)*25871 +
   48 = 27,319,824 bytes.

   To get this right, the pack tile needs to add in the 48-byte
   microblock headers for each microblock, and we also need to subtract
   out the tick bytes, which aren't known until PoH initialization is
   complete.

      fd_pack_expire_before.
    * TOO_LARGE: the transaction requested too many CUs and would never

    * ACCOUNT_CNT: the transaction tried to load more than 64 account

    * DUPLICATE_ACCT: the transaction included an account address twice
      in its list of account addresses to load.
    * ESTIMATION_FAIL: estimation of the transaction's compute cost and
      fee failed, typically because the transaction contained a
      malformed ComputeBudgetProgram instruction.

   region where the transaction should be stored.  The lifetime of this
   memory is managed by fd_pack as explained below.

   Every call to fd_pack_insert_init must be paired with a call to
   exactly one of _fini or _cancel.  Calling fd_pack_insert_txn_fini
   finalizes the transaction insert process and makes the newly-inserted
   transaction available for scheduling.  Calling
   fd_pack_insert_txn_cancel aborts the transaction insertion process.
   The txn pointer passed to _fini or _cancel must come from the most
   recent call to _init.

   The caller of these methods should not retain any read or write
   interest in the transaction after _fini or _cancel have been called.

   expires_at (for _fini only) bounds the lifetime of the inserted
   transaction.  No particular unit is prescribed, and it need not be
   higher than the previous call to txn_fini.  If fd_pack_expire_before
   has been previously called with a value larger (strictly) than the
   provided expires_at, the transaction will be rejected with EXPIRED.
   See fd_pack_expire_before for more details.

   perspective, these functions cannot fail, though pack may reject a
   transaction for a variety of reasons.  fd_pack_insert_txn_fini

/* fd_pack_insert_bundle_{init,fini,cancel} are parallel to the
   similarly named fd_pack_insert_txn functions but can be used to
   insert a bundle instead of a transaction.

   fd_pack_insert_bundle_init populates and returns bundle.
   Specifically, it populates bundle[0], ...  bundle[txn_cnt-1] with
   pointers to fd_txn_p_t structs that should receive a new transaction.
   The pointers themselves should not be changed which is what the const
   indicates, but the contents of the fd_txn_p_t structs must be changed
   in order for this to be useful.  bundle must be a pointer to the
   first element of an array of at least txn_cnt pointers.

   The bundle consists of the transactions in the order they are
   provided.  I.e. bundle[0] will execute first in the bundle.

   Like with insert_txn, every call to fd_pack_insert_bundle_init must
   be paired with a call to exactly one of _fini or _cancel.  Calling
   fd_pack_insert_bundle_fini finalizes the bundle insertion process and
   makes the newly-inserted bundle available for scheduling.  Calling
   fd_pack_insert_bundle_cancel aborts the transaction insertion
   process.  There can be at most two outstanding bundles, of which one
   should be an initializer bundle.  The bundle argument passed to _fini
   or _cancel must be the return value of a call to _init with the same
   value of txn_cnt.  Additionally, it is okay to interleave calls to
   the insert_txn family of functions with calls to the insert_bundle
   family of functions.

   The caller of these methods should not retain any read or write
   interest in the fd_txn_p_t structs that the entries of bundle
   point to after _fini or _cancel have been called.

   expires_at has the same meaning as above.  Although transactions in
   the bundle may have different recent blockhashes, all transactions in
   the bundle have the same expires_at value, since if one expires, the
   whole bundle becomes invalid.

   If initializer_bundle is non-zero, this bundle will be inserted at
   the front of the bundle queue so that it is the next bundle
   scheduled.  Otherwise, the bundle will be inserted at the back of the
   bundle queue, and will be scheduled in FIFO order with the rest of
   the bundles.  If an initializer bundle is already present in pack's
   pending transactions, that bundle will be deleted.  Additionally, if
   initializer_bundle is non-zero, the transactions in the bundle will
   not be checked against the bundle blacklist; otherwise, the check
   will be performed as normal.  See the section below on initializer
   bundles for more details.

   Other than the blacklist check, transactions in a bundle are subject
   to the same checks as other transactions.  If any transaction in the
   bundle fails validation, the whole bundle will be rejected.

   _fini also accepts bundle_meta, an optional opaque pointer to a
   region of memory of size bundle_meta_sz (as provided in pack_new).
   If bundle_meta is non-NULL, the contents of the memory will be copied
   to a metadata region associated with this bundle and can be retrieved
   later with fd_pack_peek_bundle_meta.  The contents of bundle_meta is
   not retrievable if initializer_bundle is non-zero, so you may wish to
   just pass NULL in that case.  This function does not retain any
   interest in the contents of bundle_meta after it returns.

   txn_cnt must be in [1, MAX_TXN_PER_BUNDLE].  A txn_cnt of 1 inserts a
   single-transaction bundle which is transaction with extremely high
   priority.  That said, inserting transactions as bundles instead of
   transactions can hurt performance and throughput by introducing
   unnecessary stalls.

   fd_pack_insert_bundle_fini returns one of the FD_PACK_INSERT_ACCEPT_*
   or FD_PACK_INSERT_REJECT_* codes explained above.  If there are
   multiple reasons for rejecting a bundle, the which of the reasons it
   returns is unspecified.

   These functions must not be called if the pack object was initialized
   with bundle_meta_sz==0. */

/* =========== More details about initializer bundles ===============
   Initializer bundles are a special type of bundle with special support
   from the pack object to facilitate preparing on-chain state for the
   execution of bundles by this validator.  This design is a bit
   complicated, but it eliminates excessive coupling between pack and
   block engine details.

   The pack object maintains a small state machine (initializer bundle
   abbreviated IB):

      [Not Initialized]  ------------------------->|
          ^                                        | Schedule an
          |     End            Rebate shows        | IB
          |     block          IB failed           |
          |<----------[Failed]--------------|      v
          |                               --===[Pending]
          |<------------------------------/     ^  |
          |     End block                   /---|  |
          |                                 |      | Rebate shows
          |                        Schedule |      | IB succeeded
          |                      another IB |      |
          |     End block                   |      V
          -----------------------------------===[Ready]


   When attempting to schedule a bundle the pack object checks the
   state, and employs the following rules:
   * [Not Initialized]: If the top bundle is an IB, schedule it,
     removing it like normal, then transition to [Pending].  Otherwise,
     do not schedule a bundle.
   * [Pending]: Do not schedule a bundle.
   * [Failed]: Do not schedule a bundle
   * [Ready]: Attempt to schedule the next bundle.  If scheduling an IB,
     transition to [Pending].

   As described in the state machine, ending the block (via
   fd_pack_end_block) transitions to [Not Initialized], and calls to
   fd_pack_rebate_cus control the transition out of [Pending].

   This design supports a typical block engine system where some state
   may need to be initialized at the start of the slot and some state
   may need to change between runs of transactions (e.g. 5 transactions
   from block builder A followed by 5 transactions from block builder
   B).  This can be done by inserting an initializer bundle whenever the
   top non-initializer bundle's metadata state (retrievable with
   fd_pack_peek_bundle_meta) doesn't match the current on-chain state.
   Since the initializer bundle will execute before the bundle that was
   previously the top one, by the time the non-initializer bundle
   executes, the on-chain state will be correctly configured.  In this
   scheme, in the rare case that an initializer bundle was inserted but
   never executed, it should be deleted at the end of the slot.

   If at the start of the slot, it is determined that the on-chain state
   is in good shape, the state machine can transition directly to
   [Ready] by calling fd_pack_set_initializer_bundles_ready.

   Initializer bundles are not exempt from expiration, but it should not
   be a problem if they are always inserted with the most recent
   blockhash and deleted at the end of the slot.

   Additionally, a bundle marked as an IB is exempted from the bundle
   account blacklist checks.  For this reason, it's important that IB be
   generated by trusted code with minimal or sanitized
   attacker-controlled input. */

/* fd_pack_schedule_next_microblock schedules pending transactions.
   These transaction either form a microblock, which is a set of
   non-conflicting transactions, or a bundle.  The semantics of this
   function are a bit different depending on which one it picks, but
   there are some reasons why they both use this function.

   For both codepaths, pack must be a local join of a pack object.

   Microblock case:
   Transactions part of the scheduled microblock are copied to out in no
   particular order.  The cumulative cost of these transactions will not
   exceed total_cus, and the number of transactions will not exceed the
   value of max_txn_per_microblock given in fd_pack_new.

   The block will not contain more than
   vote_fraction*max_txn_per_microblock votes, and votes in total will
   not consume more than vote_fraction*total_cus of the microblock.

   Bundle case:
   Transactions part of the scheduled bundled are copied in execution
   order (i.e. out[0] must be executed first).  The number of
   transactions will not exceed FD_PACK_MAX_TXN_PER_BUNDLE.
   max_txn_per_microblock, total_cus, and vote_fraction are ignored,
   though the block-level limits are respected.

   Both cases:
   The non_execution_cus and requested_exec_plus_acct_data_cus fields of
   each transaction will be populated with the non execution CUs and
   requested execution CUs (including cus derived from the requested
   loaded accounts data size), respectively.  The sum of these two
   values is the total cost of the transaction, i.e. what is used for
   all limits, including the total_cus value.  The lower 3 bits of the
   flags field will be populated (simple vote, bundle, initializer
   bundle). Inspecting these flags is the proper way to tell which
   codepath executed.

   Returns the number of transactions in the scheduled microblock or
   bundle.  The return value may be 0 if there are no eligible
   transactions at the moment. */

/* fd_pack_rebate_cus adjusts the compute unit accounting for the
   specified transactions to take into account the actual consumed CUs
   after execution.  When a transaction is scheduled by
   schedule_next_microblock, pack assumes that it uses all the CUs it
   requests for the purposes of several CU limits.  If it doesn't use
   all the requested CUs, this function "rebates" them to pack so that
   they can be consumed by a different transaction in the block.

   pack must be a valid local join of a pack object.  rebate must point
   to a valid rebate report produced by fd_pack_rebate_sum_t.

   IMPORTANT: CU limits are reset at the end of each block, so this
   should not be called for transactions from a prior block.
   Specifically, there must not be a call to fd_pack_end_block between
   the call to schedule_next_microblock this is paired with and the call
   to rebate_cus.

   This function operates independently of microblock_complete.  In
   general, you probably need to call both.  microblock_complete must be
   called before scheduling another microblock to that bank tile, while
   rebate_cus is optional and has much more relaxed ordering
   constraints.  The restriction about intervening calls to end_block
   and that this must come after schedule_next_microblock are the only
   ordering constraints. */
