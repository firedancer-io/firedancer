   stake to smallest stake, with ties broken by pubkey (again, largest

   in info will be retained.  lsched points to a local join of an
   fd_epoch_leaders_t object with the leader information for the slots
   when the shreds for which this shred dest object computes
   destinations were produced.  This function retains a read interest in
   lsched that persists until the memory is unformatted.  `source`
   points to the public key of the identity key of the current
   validator, i.e. the one who sends out the shreds computed by this

   Although Solana has the concept of "neighborhoods" in Turbine, we
   treat it as a standard high-radix tree, and a child is any validator
   to which the source validator should send the shred directly.
   All provided shreds must be from the same slot, and that leader for
   that slot must be known by the leader schedule.  As in
   fd_shred_dest_compute_first, shred_cnt specifies the number of
   shreds, input_shreds is accessed input_shreds[i] for i in [0,
   shred_cnt), and 0<=shred_cnt<=67.  Computes the first dest_cnt
   destinations for each shred, using a tree with fanout `fanout`.
   Exactly dest_cnt destination indices will be written for each shreds,
   so if that is more than the number of destinations that the source
   validator needs to send to, it will be padded out with
   FD_SHRED_DEST_NO_DEST.  The typical case is to pass dest_cnt==fanout.
   Results are stored in out, but there's some awkwardness associated
   with something that's logically a 2d array, so out_stride specifies
   the number of elements in each logical row of the output.
   Preciesely, destination j for shred i is written to out[ j*out_stride
   + i ]. Graphically:
   [ shred0 dest0, shred1 dest0, shred2 dest0, ... (skip until stride)
     shred0 dest1, shred1 dest1, shred2 dest1, ... (skip until 2stride)
     ...
     shred0 dest dest_cnt-1, ... ].
   out_stride must be at least shred_cnt.
   If opt_max_dest_cnt is non-NULL, the maximum number of real
   destinations for any of the provided shreds will be stored in
   opt_max_dest_cnt.  This value is always <= dest_cnt, but in many
   cases may be much lower (especially if the source validator has low
   stake).

   Returns out on success and NULL on failure. */
