/* fd_stake_ci handles the thorny problem of keeping track of leader
   schedules and shred destinations, which are epoch specific.  Around
   epoch boundaries, we may need to query information from the epoch on
   either side of the boundary.

   When you make a stake delegation change during epoch N, it becomes
   active at the start of the first slot of epoch N+1, but it doesn't
   affect the leader schedule or the shred destinations until epoch N+2.
   These methods take care all that complexity, so the caller does not

/* fd_stake_ci_stake_msg_{init, fini} are used to handle messages
   containing stake weight updates from the Rust side of the splice, and
   fd_stake_ci_dest_add_{init, fini} are used to handle messages
   containing contact info (potential shred destinations) updates from
   the Rust side of the splice.

   These are very specific to the current splices, but rather than parse
   the message in the pack and shred tiles, we parse it here.  Since
   these messages arrive on a dcache and can get overrun, both expose a
   init/fini model.

   Upon returning from a call to fd_stake_ci_{stake_msg, dest_add}_init,
   the stake contact info object will be in a stake-msg-pending or
   dest-add-pending mode, respectively, regardless of what mode it was
   in before.  In either of these modes, calls to the query functions
   (get_*_for slot) are okay and will return the same values they
   returned prior to the _init call.

   In order to call fd_stake_ci_{stake_msg, dest_add}_fini, the stake
   contact info must be in stake-msg-pending / dest-add-pending mode,
   respectively.  This means, for example, you cannot call
   fd_stake_ci_stake_msg_init followed by fd_stake_ci_dest_add_fini
   without an intervening call to fd_stake_ci_dest_add_init.  There's no
   need to cancel an operation that begun but didn't finish.  Calling
   init multiple times without calling fini will not leak any resources.

   new_message should be a pointer to the first byte of the dcache entry
   containing the stakes update.  new_message will be accessed
   new_message[i] for i in [0, FD_STAKE_CI_STAKE_MSG_SZ).

   fd_stake_ci_dest_add_init behaves slightly differently and returns a
   pointer to the first element of an array of size MAX_SHRED_DESTS-1 to
   be populated.  This allows the caller to add augment the information
   in the message from Rust with additional information (i.e. mac
   addresses).  The `cnt` argument to _dest_add_fini specifies the
   number of elements of the array returned by _init that were
   populated. 0<=cnt<MAX_SHRED_DESTS.  _fini will only read the first
   `cnt` elements of the array.  The identity pubkey provided at
   initialization must not be one of the cnt values in the array.  The
   caller should not retain a read or write interest in the pointer
   returned by _init after fini has been called, or after the caller has
   determined that fini will not be called for that update, e.g. because
   the update was overrun.  Calls to _fini may clobber the array.  */

   worth mentioning again there's nothing like the adjustment performed
