/* This header defines several methods for building and validating FEC
   sets from received shreds.  It's designed just for use by the shred
   tile, which is why it's in disco/shred.

   The primary complication in the interface comes from lifetimes.
   Buffers returned by the networking layer are typically ephemeral, we
   need to hold onto the data until we've finished the FEC set, so we
   need at least one memcpy.  Once we complete the FEC set, the result
   needs to go out on an mcache/dcache pair and on the network, which
   also have different lifetime requirements.  The FEC resolver goes out
   of its way to use memory in a way that doesn't require a second
   memcpy once the FEC set is complete.  To that end, the FEC resolver
   makes two promises:
   1. Once memory has been used for a specific FEC set, it will not be
      reused for a different FEC set until at least partial_depth other
      distinct FEC sets have been returned in the out_fec_set field of
      fd_fec_resolver_add_shred.
   2. Once a FEC set is complete (specified with COMPLETES), the
      associated memory will not be reused for a different FEC set until
      at least complete_depth other distinct FEC sets have been returned
      from calls to fd_fec_resolver_add_shred that return
      SHRED_COMPLETES.

   This is implemented using a freelist with an insertion point in the
   middle (which can also be seen as two chained freelists):
                 ------------------------
                 |   In progress FEC    |--------- if completed -
                 |    sets (<=depth)    |                       |

   When a shred arrives for a new FEC set, we pull an entry from the
   head of the free FEC set queue.  If that would result in more than
   depth sets in progress, we spill the oldest in progress set, and
   insert it at the tail of the free set queue.  When we complete a set,
   we remove it from the in progress set, add it to the tail of the
   completed FEC set queue, and move one element from the head of the
   completed queue to the tail of the free queue.

   Since the completed queue only advances when an FEC set is completed,
   any complete FEC set stays in that queue for at least complete_depth
   completions.

   It might seems like this system is overkill and one combined longer
   freelist would suffice, but that's incorrect. Consider the following
   scenario: Suppose we've just completed FEC set A, so we return it
   with COMPLETES and then we put it at the end of the free list.  Now
   we receive a shred for a new FEC set, so we take memory from the head
   of the free list.  That happens many times, but we never receive
   enough shreds for any FEC set to complete one.  Eventually, we churn
   through the whole singular freelist with spilling until the memory we
   used for A gets to the head of the freelist.  Finally we receive
   enough shreds to complete the FEC set, so we return A with COMPLETES.
   Thus, from the perspective of a consumer that only cares about
   completed FEC sets, we've returned the same piece of memory twice in
   a row. */

   received, SHRED_IGNORED will be returned, and nothing will be written
   to out_fec_set or out_shred.  Note that only light validation is
   performed on a duplicate shred, so a shred that is actually invalid
   but looks like a duplicate of a previously received valid shred may
   be considered SHRED_IGNORED instead of SHRED_REJECTED.
