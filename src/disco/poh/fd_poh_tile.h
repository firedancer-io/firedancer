/* When we are becoming leader, and we think the prior leader might have
   skipped their slot, we give them a grace period to finish.  In the
   Agave client this is called grace ticks.  This is a courtesy to
   maintain network health, and is not strictly necessary.  It is
   actually advantageous to us as new leader to take over right away and
   give no grace period, since we could generate more fees.

   Here we define the grace period to be two slots, which is taken from
   Agave directly. */

/* The maximum number of microblocks that pack is allowed to pack into a
   single slot.  This is not consensus critical, and pack could, if we
   let it, produce as many microblocks as it wants, and the slot would
   still be valid.

   We have this here instead so that PoH can estimate slot completion,
   and keep the hashcnt up to date as pack progresses through packing
   the slot.  If this upper bound was not enforced, PoH could tick to
   the last hash of the slot and have no hashes left to mixin incoming
   microblocks from pack, so this upper bound is a coordination
   mechanism so that PoH can progress hashcnts while the slot is active,
   and know that pack will not need those hashcnts later to do mixins. */

/* When we are hashing in the background in case a prior leader skips
   their slot, we need to store the result of each tick hash so we can
   publish them when we become leader.  The network requires at least
   one leader slot to publish in each epoch for the leader schedule to
   generate, so in the worst case we might need two full epochs of slots
   to store the hashes.  (Eg, if epoch T only had a published slot in
   position 0 and epoch T+1 only had a published slot right at the end).

   There is a tighter bound: the block data limit of mainnet-beta is
   currently FD_PACK_MAX_DATA_PER_BLOCK, or 27,332,342 bytes per slot.
   At 48 bytes per tick, it is not possible to publish a slot that skips
   569,424 or more prior slots. */
