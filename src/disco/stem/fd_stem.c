#include "fd_stem.h"

/* fd_stem provides services to multiplex multiple streams of input
   fragments and present them to a mix of reliable and unreliable
   consumers as though they were generated by multiple different
   multi-stream producers.  The code can be included to generate
   a definition of stem_run which can be called as a tile main run
   loop.

   The template supports various callback functions which can be
   defined like #define STEM_CALLBACK_BEFORE_FRAG before_frag to
   tune the behavior of the stem_run loop.  The callbacks are:

     DURING_HOUSEKEEPING
   Is called during the housekeeping routine, which happens infrequently
   on a schedule determined by the stem (based on the lazy parameter,
   see fd_tempo.h for more information).  It is appropriate to do
   slightly expensive things here that wouldn't be OK to do in the main
   loop, like updating sequence numbers that are shared with other tiles
   (e.g. synchronization information), or sending batched information
   somewhere.  The ctx is a user-provided context object from when the
   stem was initialized.

     METRICS_WRITE
   By convention, tiles may wish to accumulate high traffic metrics
   locally so they don't cause a lot of cache coherency traffic, and
   then periodically publish them to external observers.  This callback
   is here to support that use case.  It occurs infrequently during the
   housekeeping loop, and is called inside a compiler fence to ensure
   the writes do not get reordered, which may be important for observers
   or monitoring tools.  The ctx is a user-provided context object from
   when the stem tile was initialized.

     BEFORE_CREDIT
   Is called every iteration of the stem run loop, whether there is a
   new frag ready to receive or not.  This callback is also still
   invoked even if the stem is backpressured and cannot read any new
   fragments while waiting for downstream consumers to catch up.  This
   callback is useful for things that need to occur even if no new frags
   are being handled.  For example, servicing network connections could
   happen here.  The ctx is a user-provided context object from when the
   stem tile was initialized.  The stem is the stem which is invoking
   this callback. The stem should only be used for calling
   fd_stem_publish to publish a fragment to downstream consumers.

   The charge_busy argument is 0 by default, and should be set to 1 if
   the before_credit function is doing work that should be accounted for
   as part of the tiles busy indicator.

      AFTER_CREDIT
   Is called every iteration of the stem run loop, whether there is a
   new frag ready to receive or not, except in cases where the stem is
   backpressured by a downstream consumer and would not be able to
   publish.  The callback might be used for publishing new fragments to
   downstream consumers in the main loop which are not in response to an
   incoming fragment.  For example, code that collects incoming
   fragments over a period of 1 second and joins them together before
   publishing a large block fragment downstream, would publish the block
   here. The ctx is a user-provided context object from when the stem
   tile was initialized.  The stem is the stem which is invoking this
   callback. The stem should only be used for calling fd_stem_publish to
   publish a fragment to downstream consumers.

   The opt_poll_in argument determines if the stem should proceed with
   checking for new fragments to consumer, or should `continue` the main
   stem loop to do credit checking again.  This could be used if the
   after_credit function publishes, and the flow control needs to be
   checked again.  By default, opt_poll_in is true and the stem will
   poll for fragments right away without rerunning the loop or checking
   for credits.

   The charge_busy argument is 0 by default, and should be set to 1 if
   the after_credit function is doing work that should be accounted for
   as part of the tiles busy indicator.

      BEFORE_FRAG
   Is called immediately whenever a new fragment has been detected that
   was published by an upstream producer.  The signature and sequence
   number (sig and seq) provided as arguments are read atomically from
   shared memory, so must both match each other from the published
   fragment (aka. they will not be torn or partially overwritten).
   in_idx is an index in [0, num_ins) indicating which producer
   published the fragment. No fragment data has been read yet here, nor
   has other metadata, for example the size or timestamps of the
   fragment.  Mainly this callback is useful for deciding whether to
   filter the fragment based on its signature.  If the return value is
   non-zero, the frag will be skipped completely, no fragment data will
   be read, and the in will be advanced so that we now wait for the next
   fragment.  The ctx is a user-provided context object from when the
   stem tile was initialized.

      DURING_FRAG
   Is called after the stem has received a new frag from an in, but
   before the stem has checked that it was overrun.  This callback is
   not invoked if the stem is backpressured, as it would not try and
   read a frag from an in in the first place (instead, leaving it on the
   in mcache to backpressure the upstream producer).  in_idx will be the
   index of the in that the frag was received from. If the producer of
   the frags is respecting flow control, it is safe to read frag data in
   any of the callbacks, but it is suggested to copy or read frag data
   within this callback, as if the producer does not respect flow
   control, the frag may be torn or corrupt due to an overrun by the
   reader.  If the frag being read from has been overwritten while this
   callback is running, the frag will be ignored and the stem will not
   call the process function.  Instead it will recover from the overrun
   and continue with new frags. This function cannot fail.  The ctx is a
   user-provided context object from when the stem tile was initialized.
   seq, sig, chunk, and sz are the respective fields from the mcache
   fragment that was received.  If the producer is not respecting flow
   control, these may be corrupt or torn and should not be trusted,
   except for seq which is read atomically.

      AFTER_FRAG
   Is is called immediately after the DURING_FRAG, along with an
   additional check that the reader was not overrun while handling the
   frag.  If the reader was overrun, the frag is abandoned and this
   function is not called.  This callback is not invoked if the stem is
   backpressured, as it would not read a frag in the first place.
   in_idx will be the index of the in that the frag was received from.
   You should not read the frag data directly here, as it might still
   get overrun, instead it should be copied out of the frag during the
   read callback if needed later. This function cannot fail. The ctx is
   a user-provided context object from when the stem tile was
   initialized.  stem should only be used for calling fd_stem_publish to
   publish a fragment to downstream consumers.  seq is the sequence
   number of the fragment that was read from the input mcache. sig,
   chunk, sz, and tsorig are the respective fields from the mcache
   fragment that was received.  If the producer is not respecting flow
   control, these may be corrupt or torn and should not be trusted. */
