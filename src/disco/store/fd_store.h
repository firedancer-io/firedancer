/* fd_store is a high-performance in-memory storage engine for shreds as
   they are received from the network.

   The elements in the store themselves are not shreds, but FEC set
   payloads.  Briefly, FEC sets are groupings of shreds that encode the
   same data but provide redundancy and security.  While Firedancer
   receives individual shreds over Turbine / Repair (the relevant Solana
   protocols), a lot of Firedancer's validation of those shreds can only
   be done at the FEC set boundary.  Also, there are potential future
   protocol changes to encode all shreds in a FEC set so that they can
   only be decoded once the entire FEC set is received ("all-coding").

   Therefore, the FEC set becomes the logical unit for the store vs.
   individual shreds.  Replay will only ever attempt replay of a FEC set
   so there is no need to store at the granularity of individual shreds.
   The store is essentially a mapping of merkle root->FEC set payload,
   in which the merkle root was produced by feeding every shred in a FEC
   set into a merkle tree.  This uniquely identifies a FEC set, because
   if any of the shreds change, the merkle root changes.

   Shreds are coalesced and inserted into the store as bytes.  The max
   bytes per FEC set is currently variable-length but capped at 63985.
   In the future this will be fixed to 31840 bytes, when FEC sets are
   enforced to always be 32 shreds.

   The shared memory used by a store instance is within a workspace such
   that it is also persistent and remotely inspectable.  Store is
   designed to be used inter-process (allowing concurrent joins from
   multiple tiles), relocated in memory (via wksp operations), and
   accessed concurrently (managing conflicts with a lock).

   EQUIVOCATION

   There is a protocol violation called equivocation (also known as
   "duplicates") that results in two or more blocks for the same slot.
   The actual conflict occurs at the shred level: a leader produces two
   or more shreds for the same slot at the same index, with different
   data payloads.  The result will be two different FEC sets for the
   same "logical" FEC set based on (slot, fec_set_idx).

   Unfortunately a naive keying scheme such as (slot, fec_set_idx) is
   insufficient as a result of equivocation.  As mentioned earlier,
   Store instead uses the merkle root as the key for its FEC set
   elements, at the cost of some keying performance and complexity.

   ARCHITECTURE

   In the Firedancer topology, Shred tile writes to store and Replay
   tile reads from store.  Replay tile only reads from the store after
   Repair tile (which is downstream of Shred) has notified Replay that a
   FEC set is ready.  Shred's writes are append-only and Replay is
   responsible for publishing once it is done consuming (signaled by a
   new Tower root).

   Shred (writes) -> Repair (notif) -> Replay (reads, publishes)

   ORDERING

   In the above architecture, Repair delivers FEC sets to Replay in
   partial order.  Any given fork will be delivered in-order, but
   concurrent forks can be delivered in arbitrary order.  Another way to
   phrase this is a parent FEC set will always be delivered before the
   child (see fd_fec_chainer).

   CONCURRENCY

   It is possible to design Store access in a way that enables parallel
   writes and minimizes lock contention between readers and writers.
   Store contains a fd_rwlock (read-write lock), but the name is a bit
   of a misnomer because writes can actually be concurrent and the only
   operation that will actually need the write lock is publish, which
   will be done by Replay.  It is more appropriate to describe as an
   exclusive-shared access lock.

   In this design, writers (Shred tiles) hold the shared lock during
   their access.  The reader (Replay tile) also holds the shared lock
   during its access, and given both Shred and Replay will be taking out
   shared locks, they will not contend.

   For parallel writes, the Store's hash function is carefully designed
   to partition the keyspace so that the same Shred tile always writes
   to the same map slots.  This ensures map collisions always happen on
   the same Shred tile and cannot happen across tiles.  Specifically, if
   two different FEC sets hash to the same slot, it is guaranteed that
   to be the same Shred tile processing both those FEC sets.  This
   prevents a data race in which multiple Shred tiles (each with a
   handle to the shared lock) write to the same map slot.

   The hash function is defined as follows:
   ```
   #define MAP_KEY_HASH(key,seed) ((ulong)key->mr.ul[0]%seed + (key)->part*seed)
   ```
   where `key` is a key type that includes the merkle root (32 bytes)
   and the partition index (4 bytes) that is equivalent to the Shred
   tile index doing the insertion.  seed, on initialization, is the
   number of chains/buckets in the map_chain divided by the number of
   partitions.  In effect, seed is the size of each partition.  For
   example, if the map_chain is sized to 1024, and there are 4 shred
   tiles, then the seed is 1024/4 = 256.  Then the map key hash can
   bound the chain index of each partition as such: shred tile 0 will
   write to chains 0-255, shred tile 1 will write to chains 256-511,
   shred tile 2 will write to chains 512-767, and shred tile 3 will
   write to chains 768-1023, without overlap.  The merkle root is a 32
   byte SHA-256 hash, so we can expect a fairly uniform distribution of
   hash values even after truncating to the first 8 bytes, without
   needing to introduce more randomness.  Thus we can repurpose the
   `seed` argument to be the number of partitions.

   Essentially, this allows for limited single-producer single-consumer
   (SPSC) concurrency, where the producer is a given Shred tile and the
   consumer is Replay tile.  The SPSC concurrency is limited in that the
   Store should 1. only be read by Replay after Repair has notified
   Replay it is time to read (ie. Shred has finished writing), and 2. be
   written to by Shred(s) in append-only fashion, so Shred never
   modifies or removes from the map.  Store is backed by fd_map_chain,
   which is not thread-safe generally, but does support this particular
   SPSC concurrency model in cases where the consumer is guaranteed to
   be lagging the producer.

   Analyzing fd_map_chain in gory detail, in the case of a map collision
   where Replay tile is reading an element and Shred tile writes a new
   element to the same map slot, that new element is prepended to the
   hash chain within that slot (which modifies what the head of the
   chain points to as well as the now-previous head in the hash chain's
   `.next` field, but does not touch application data).  With fencing
   enabled (FD_MAP_INSERT_FENCING), it is guaranteed the consumer either
   reads the head before or after the update.  If it reads before, that
   is safe, it would just check the key (if no match, iterate down the
   chain etc.)  If it reads after, it is also safe because the new
   element is guaranteed to be before the old element in the chain, so
   it would just do one more iteration.  Note the consumer should always
   use fd_store_query_const to ensure the underlying fd_map_chain is not
   modified during querying.

   The exception to the above is publishing.  Publishing requires
   exclusive access because it involves removing from fd_map_chain,
   which is not safe for shared access.  So the Replay tile should take
   out the exclusive lock.  Publishing happens at most once per slot, so
   it is a relatively infrequent Store access compared to FEC queries
   and inserts (which is good because it is also the most expensive). */
