<!--
This file describes all possible metrics that could potentially be
collected and reported by Firedancer.  Metrics are grouped into
categories.

These metrics must be backwards compatible and you should not change
existing metric names.  Instead they should be deprecated and a new
metric introduced.

<metrics>

<group name="Tile" tile="all">
    <gauge name="Pid" units="pid" summary="The process ID of the tile." />
</group>

<group name="Stem" tile="all">
    <gauge name="InBackpressure" units="bool" summary="Whether the tile is currently backpressured or not." />
    <counter name="Backpressure" units="count" summary="Number of times the times the tile has transitioned from not backpressured to backpressured." />

    <histogram name="LoopDuration{StemLoopType}" units="seconds">
        <summary>
            The time it took to turn one core loop of the tile. The loop types
            are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, so the sum of time across all
            of them should give the total running time of the total, less some
            measurement error.
        </summary>
        <variants name="StemLoopType">
            <variant name="Housekeeping" />
            <variant name="Backpressure" />
            <variant name="CaughtUp" />

            <variant name="Finish" />
        </variants>
    </histogram>

    <histogram name="FragmentSize{StemHandledType}" units="bytes">
        <summary>
            The size of the fragments that are being processed by the tile.
        </summary>
        <variants name="StemHandledType">
            <variant name="Filtered" />
            <variant name="Handled" />
        </variants>

</group>

<group name="Quic" tile="quic">
    <gauge name="ActiveConnections" units="connections" summary="The number of active QUIC connections." />
    <counter name="TotalConnections" units="connections" summary="The total number of connections that have been opened." />
