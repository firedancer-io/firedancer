<!--
This file describes all possible metrics that could potentially be
collected and reported by Firedancer.  Metrics are grouped into
categories.

These metrics must be backwards compatible and you should not change
existing metric names.  Instead they should be deprecated and a new
metric introduced.

    <counter name="BackpressureCount" summary="Number of times the times the tile has had to wait for one of more consumers to catch up to resume publishing." />

    <!-- The "ticks" converter means that the measurement is sampled in
         ticks (so it can be done quickly) but reported to the metrics
         observer as seconds.  The min and max are in terms of seconds,
         not ticks, from 50 nanoseconds to 50 microseconds. -->
    <histogram name="LoopHousekeepingDurationSeconds" min="0.000000050" max="0.000050" converter="seconds">
        <summary>
            Duration of one iteration of the run loop which did
            housekeeping. The various loop durations are mutually
            exclusive and exhaustive, so the sum of time across all of
            them is roughly the total running time of the tile. Loop
            durations are per iteration of the run loop and
            non-blocking, so for example each 'caught up' sample does
            not represent the time we waited for new input data, but
            rather how long each iteration of the spin loop waiting for
            the data took.
