    # How many writer tiles to run.  Writer tiles are responsible for
    # writing account changes made by the exec tiles back to the
    # accounts DB.
    #
    # Since the accounts DB is designed to be highly concurrent, most of
    # the time account writeback can be done in parallel without
    # blocking.  Multiple writer tiles exploit this parallelism supported
    # by the accounts DB.
    #
    # If sufficient cores are available, it is recommended to set this to
    # the same as the number of exec tiles.  However, there's no reason
    # for this to exceed the number of exec tiles, because the number
    # of in-flight transactions between exec tiles and writer tiles is
    # bounded by the number of exec tiles.
