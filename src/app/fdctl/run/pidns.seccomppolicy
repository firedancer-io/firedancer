# There are two policies involved in booting Firedancer, one for the
# init process that creates a child process with a PID namespace, and
# one for the child process with the PID namespace which launches tiles.
#
# This policy is for the child process which launches tiles.  This
# process is the init process (PID 0) of the PID namespace, and so if
# it is killed all Firedancer tiles will be terminated by the kernel.

# logfile_fd: It can be disabled by configuration, but typically tiles
#             will open a log file on boot and write all messages there.

#
# 'WARNING' and above are written to the STDERR pipe, while all messages
# are always written to the log file.

# arg 0 is the file descriptor to write to.  The boot process ensures
# that descriptor 2 is always STDERR and descriptor 4 is the logfile.

# supervisor: poll for any child tile process to exit
#
# Tiles should not exit on their own, so after booting them the pidns
# process simply waits for any child to exit, and if this happens
# terminates the whole process group with a diagnostic message.
#
# Pipe file descriptors are used with poll() to detect process exit (the
# pipe will SIGHUP) rather than waitpid() so that we can wait for
# grandchildren and the parent process, rather than just direct
# children.  The third parameter to poll(), timeout, is an int, and we
# pass -1.  The BPF program treats all args as ulongs though.

# it to get the exit status and print diagnostic information before
# terminating the rest of the process group.

# When the wait4 above completes, the child process has exited and the
# parent will now need to exit itself, which will terminate all tiles
# as well.
