# There are two policies involved in booting Firedancer, one for the
# init process that creates a child process with a PID namespace, and
# one for the child process with the PID namespace which launches tiles.
#
# This policy is for the boot process that creates the PID namespace.
# The process does almost nothing except spawn the child, and then sit
# waiting for it to exit like a supervisor.

# pid_namespace: This is the PID of the child process that we created.
#                There is always exactly one such process.
unsigned int pid_namespace

# logging: write diagnostic messages to a pipe
#
# The boot process will write simple error messages to STDERR if the
# child pidns process terminate.
#
# arg 0 is the file descriptor to write to.  The boot process ensures
# that descriptor 2 is always STDERR.
write: (eq (arg 0) 2)

# supervisor: wait for the child process to exit
#
# The boot process needs to know when the child exits so that it can
# quit itself.  The child is created with WCLONE so this is required.

# supervisor: exit when the child process exits
#
# When the wait4 above completes, the child process has exited and the
# parent will now need to exit itself.

# supervisor: kill the child process
#
# Since the supervisor is the foreground process for the terminal,
# signals like SIGINT (Ctrl+C) will go there if the user wishes to
# kill Firedancer.  The child process must be killed as part of the
# shutdown sequence.
