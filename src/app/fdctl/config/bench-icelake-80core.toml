# Configuration file used for benchmarking on an Intel Icelake CPU with
# AVX512 support for the 1.4 Milestone demo.  The configuration expects
# 80 physical cores (40 on each socket of a dual socket CPU).  In
# production the configuration would be different as cores do not need
# to be dedicated to generating and sending transactions for
# benchmarking.
#
# This configuration assumes the physical CPU ids are striped across two
# NUMA nodes, so the CPUs on node0 are 0, 2, 4, 6, ... and the CPUs on
# node1 are 1, 3, 5, ...
