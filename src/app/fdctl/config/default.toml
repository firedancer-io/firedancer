# Name of this Firedancer instance.  This name serves as a unique token
# so that multiple Firedancer instances can run side by side without

# or overwrite any state created by a prior or currently running
# instance with the same name.

# The operating system user to permission data and run Firedancer as.
# Firedancer needs to start privileged, either with various capabilities
# or as root, so that it can configure kernel bypass networking.  Once
# this configuration has been performed, the process will enter a highly
# restrictive sandbox, drop all privileges, and switch to the user given
# here.  When running the configuration steps of `fdctl configure` data
# will be permissioned so that is it writable for this user and not the
# user which is performing the configuration.
#
# Firedancer requires nothing from this user, and it should be as
# minimally permissioned as is possible.  It is suggested to run
# Firedancer as a separate user from other processes on the machine so
# that they cannot attempt to send signals, ptrace, or otherwise
# interfere with the process.  You should under no circumstances use a
# superuser or privileged user here, and Firedancer will not allow you
# to use the root user.  It is also not a good idea to use a user that
# has access to `sudo` or has other entries in the sudoers file.
#
# Firedancer will automatically determine a user to run as if none is
# provided.  By default, the user is determined by the following
# sequence:
#
#  1. The `SUDO_USER`, `LOGNAME`, `USER`, `LNAME`, or `USERNAME`
#     environment variables are checked in this order, and if one of
#     them is set that user is used
#  2. The `/proc/self/loginuid` file is used to determine the UID, and
#     the username is looked up in nss (the name service switch).
#
# This means if running as sudo, the user will be the terminal user
# which invoked sudo, not the root user.

# Firedancer logs to two places by default: stderr and a logfile.
# stdout is not used for logging, and will only be used to print command
# output or boot errors.  Messages to "stderr" are abbreviated and not
# as fully detailed as those to the log file.  The log file is intended
# for long term archival purposes.  The log levels mirror the Linux
# syslog levels, which are, from lowest to highest priority:
#
#   - DEBUG    Development and diagnostic messages.
#   - INFO     Less important informational notice.
#   - NOTICE   More important informational notice.
#   - WARNING  Unexpected condition, shouldn't happen. Should be
#              investigated.
#   - ERR      Kills Firedancer. Routine error, likely programmer error.
#   - CRIT     Kills Firedancer. Critical errors.
#   - ALERT    Kills Firedancer. Alert requiring immediate attention.
#   - EMERG    Kills Firedancer. Emergency requiring immediate
#              attention, security or risk issue.
#
# Default behaviors are:
#
#   - DEBUG messages are not written to either stream.
#   - INFO messages are written in detailed form to the log file.
#   - NOTICE is INFO + messages are written in summary form to
#     stderr.
#   - WARNING is NOTICE + the log file is flushed to disk.
#   - ERR and above are WARNING + the program will be exited with an
#     error code of 1.
#
# All processes in Firedancer share one log file, and they all inherit
# STDERR and STDOUT from the launcher.  An example log message would
# look something like:
#
#    NOTICE  01-23 04:56:07.890123 45678 f0 0 src/file.c(901): 1 is the loneliest number

# CPU cores in Firedancer are carefully managed.  Where a typical
# program lets the operating system scheduler determine which threads to
# run on which cores and for how long, Firedancer overrides most of this
# behavior by pinning threads to CPU cores.
#
# The validator splits all work into eleven distinct jobs, with each
# thread running one of the jobs:
#
#  - net        Sends and receives network packets from the network
#               device
#
#  - quic       Receives transactions from clients, performing all
#               connection management and packet processing to manage
#               and implement the QUIC protocol
#
#  - verify     Verifies the cryptographic signature of incoming
#               transactions, filtering invalid ones
#
#  - dedup      Checks for and filters out duplicated incoming
#               transactions
#
#  - pack       Collects incoming transactions and smartly schedules
#               them for execution when we are leader
#
#  - bank       Executes transactions that have been scheduled when we
#               are leader
#
#  - poh        Continuously hashes in the background, and mixes the
#               hash in with executed transactions to prove passage of
#               time
#
#  - shred      Distributes block data to the network when leader, and
#               receives and retransmits block data when not leader
#
#  - store      Receives block data when we are leader, or from other
#               nodes when they are leader, and stores it locally in a
#               database on disk
#
#  - metric     Collects monitoring information about other tiles and
#               serves it on an HTTP endpoint
#
#  - sign       Holds the validator private key, and receives and
#               responds to signing requests from other tiles
#
# The jobs involved in producing blocks when we are leader are organized
# in a pipeline, where transactions flow through the system in a linear
# sequence.
#
#   net -> quic -> verify -> dedup -> pack -> bank -> poh -> shred -> store
#
# Some of these jobs (net, quic, verify, bank, and shred) can be
# parallelized, and run on multiple CPU cores at once. For example, we
# could structure the pipeline like this for performance:
#
# net -> quic +-> verify -+> dedup -> pack +-> bank -+> poh -> shred -> store
#             +-> verify -+                +-> bank -+
#             +-> verify -+
#             +-> verify -+
#
# Each instance of a job running on a CPU core is called a tile.  In
# this configuration we are running 4 verify tiles and 2 bank tiles.
#
# The problem of deciding which cores to use, and what job to run on
# each core we call layout.  Layout is system dependent and the highest
# throughput layout will vary depending on the specific hardware
# available.
#
# Tiles communicate with each other using message queues.  If a queue
# between two tiles fills up, the producer will either block, waiting
# until there is free space to continue which is referred to as
# backpressure, or it will drop transactions or data and continue.
#
# A slow tile can cause backpressure through the rest of the system
# causing it to halt, and the goal of adding more tiles is to increase
# throughput of a job, preventing dropped transactions.  For example,
# if the QUIC server was producing 100,000 transactions a second, but
# each verify tile could only handle 20,000 transactions a second, five
# of the verify tiles would be needed to keep up without dropping
# transactions.
#
# A full Firedancer layout spins up these eleven tasks onto a variety of
# CPU cores and connects them together with queues so that data can flow
# in and out of the system with maximum throughput and minimal drops.
[layout]
    # Logical CPU cores to run Firedancer tiles on.  Can be specified as
    # a single core like "0", a range like "0-10", or a range with
    # stride like "0-10/2".  Stride is useful when CPU cores should be
    # skipped due to hyperthreading.  You can also have a number
    # preceded by a 'f' like 'f5' which means the next five tiles are
    # not pinned and will float on the original core set that Firedancer
    # was started with.
    #
    # For example, if Firedancer has six tiles numbered 0..5, and the
    # affinity is specified as
    #
    #  f1,0-1,2-4/2,f1
    #
    # Then the tile to core mapping looks like,

    # If the value is specified as auto, Firedancer will attempt to
    # determine the best layout for the system.  This is the default

    # subprocess and all of its threads are allowed to run on.  This is
    # specified in the same format as the above Firedancer affinity.
    #
    # It is strongly suggested that you do not overlap the Firedancer
    # affinity with the Agave affinity, as Firedancer tiles expect
    # to have exclusive use of their core.  Unexpected latency spikes
    # due to context switching may decrease performance overall.

#     directory.  Any file created within these file systems will be
#     backed by in-memory pages of the desired size.
#
#  3. At Firedancer initialization time, Firedancer creates a

        #   paying transactions available.  This strategy results in
        #   consistently 100% full blocks.
        #
        #   When using the perf scheduling mode, there is no reason to
        #   increase the bank tile count beyond the default of 4.
        #
        #  "balanced" (default)
        #   Try to fill the block at a rate that is just fast enough to
        #   fill it by the end.  This strategy optimizes for revenue
        #   from priority fees, but can result in blocks that are not
        #   always 100% full, and can be poor at capturing MEV if using
        #   an external block builder.
        #
        #   When using the balanced mode, there is no reason to increase
        #   bank tile count beyond the default of 4.
        #
        #  "revenue"
        #   Fill blocks extremely lazily, saving most work for the end
        #   of the block.  This strategy results in high revenue from
        #   MEV, but results in regularly unfull blocks, and decreased
        #   priority fees compared to the balanced strategy.
        #
        #   When scheduling with the revenue mode, it is suggested to
        #   use a high number of bank tiles.  The more bank tiles in

        #   short working window at the end of each slot.
        #
        #   WARNING: The revenue scheduler is deprecated and will be
        #   removed in a future version.
