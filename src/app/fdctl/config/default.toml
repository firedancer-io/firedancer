# or as root, so that it can configure kernel bypass networking.  Once
# this configuration has been performed, the process will enter a highly
# restrictive sandbox, drop all privileges, and switch to the user given
# here.  When running the configuration steps of `fdctl configure`, data
# will be permissioned as read/write for this user, irrespective of
# which user is performing the configuration.

# Firedancer requires nothing from this user, and it should be as
# minimally permissioned as is possible.  It is suggested to run
# Firedancer as a separate user from other processes on the machine so

# to use the root user.  It is also not a good idea to use a user that
# has access to `sudo` or has other entries in the sudoers file.

# CPU cores in Firedancer are carefully managed.  Where a typical
# program lets the operating system scheduler determine which threads to
# run on which cores and for how long, Firedancer overrides most of this
# behavior by pinning threads to CPU cores.
#
# Consider a validator node needing to do six essential pieces of work:
#
#  1. quic      Parse received QUIC packets into transactions, and
#               respond to the client appropriately
#  2. verify    Verify the signature of the transaction, dropping
#               invalid ones
#  3. dedup     Drop duplicated or repeatedly sent transactions
#  4. pack      Decide which transactions to execute, ordering them by
#               profitability
#  5. bank      Run the transactions in order and update accounting
#  6. shred     Sign outgoing messages and forward to other validators
#
# This is a data pipeline.  When we model the flow of a transaction
# through the system, it's a simple linear sequence, and could run
# nicely on six CPU cores, one for each stage,
#
#   1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6
#
# Transactions can largely be processed independently, except for
# deduplication.  With that in mind, if we had ten CPU cores, we could
# make our pipeline faster by parallelizing it as follows,
#
#   1 -> 2 --> 3 --> 4 --> 5 -> 6
#           |          |
#   1 -> 2 -+          +-> 5 -> 6
#
# The problem of deciding which cores to use, and what work to run on
# each core we call layout.  Layout is system dependent and the highest
# throughput layout will vary depending on the specific hardware
# available.
#
# Pinning and layout is accomplished with help from a primitive we call
# a tile.  A tile is a thread which you can dispatch work to.  Tiles may
# either be pinned to a specific core, or float between unassigned cores
# (the OS scheduler will assign).  While a tile could receive and handle
# arbitrary new work requests over its lifetime, acting like a worker
# thread in a thread pool, in practice most tiles are dispatched just
# one piece of work at startup, one of the six described above, which
# they run forever.
#
# The concurrency model is that each tile runs exclusively on its own
# thread, and communicates with other tiles via. message passing.  The
# message passing primitives are built on top of shared memory, but
# tiles do not otherwise communicate via. shared memory.  These message
# queues between tiles are all fixed size, and when a producer outruns a
# downstream consumer and fills the outgoing buffer transactions will be
# dropped.
#
# A full Firedancer layout spins up these six tasks onto a variety of
# tiles and connects them together with queues so that data can flow in
# and out of the system with maximum throughput and minimal overruns.

    # Logical CPU cores to run Firedancer tiles on.  Can be specified as
    # a single core like "0", a range like "0-10", or a range with

    # skipped due to hyperthreading.  You can also have a number
    # preceded by a 'f' like 'f5' which means the next five tiles are
    # not pinned and will float on the original core set that Firedancer

# All memory that will be used in Firedancer is pre-allocated in two
# kinds of pages: huge and gigantic.  Huge pages are 2MB and gigantic
# pages are 1GB.  This is done to prevent TLB misses which can have a
# high performance cost.  There are three important steps in this
# configuration,
#
#  1. At boot time or soon after, the kernel is told to allocate a
#     certain number of both huge and gigantic pages to a special pool
#     so that they are reserved for later use by privileged programs.
#
#  2. At configuration time, one (pseudo) filesystem of type hugetlbfs
#     for each of huge and gigantic pages is mounted on a local
#     directory.  Any file created within these filesystems will be
#     backed by in-memory pages of the desired size.
#
#  3. At Firedancer initialization time, Firedancer creates a
#     "workspace" file in one of these mounts.  The workspace is a
#     single mapped memory region within which the program lays out and
#     initializes all of the data structures it will need in advance.
