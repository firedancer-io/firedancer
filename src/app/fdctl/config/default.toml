# CPU cores in Firedancer are carefully managed.  Where a typical
# program lets the operating system scheduler determine which threads to
# run on which cores and for how long, Firedancer overrides most of this
# behavior by pinning threads to CPU cores.
#
# Consider a validator node needing to do six essential pieces of work:
#
#  1. serve     Server for client transactions on a network device
#  2. verify    Verify the signature of the transaction, dropping
#     invalid ones
#  3. dedup     Drop duplicated or repeatedly sent transactions
#  4. pack      Decide which transactions to execute, ordering them by
#               profitability
#  5. bank      Run the transactions in order and update accounting
#  6. shred     Sign outgoing messages and forward to other validators
#
# This is a data pipeline.  When we model the flow of a transaction
# through the system, it's a simple linear sequence, and could run
# nicely on six CPU cores, one for each stage,
#
#   1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6
#
# Transactions can largely be processed indepdendently, except for
# deduplication.  With that in mind, if we had ten CPU cores, we could
# make our pipeline faster by parallelizing it as follows,
#
#   1 -> 2 --> 3 --> 4 --> 5 -> 6
#           |          |
#   1 -> 2 -+          +-> 5 -> 6
#
# The problem of deciding which cores to use, and what work to run on
# each core we call layout.  Layout is system dependent and the highest
# throughput layout will vary depending on the specific hardware
# available.
#
# Pinning and layout is accomplished with help from a primitive we call
# a tile. A tile is a thread which you can dispatch work to.  Tiles may
# either be pinned to a specific core, or float between unassigned cores
# (the OS scheduler will assign).  While a tile could receive and handle
# arbitrary new work requests over its lifetime, acting like a worker
# thread in a thread pool, in practice most tiles are dispatched just
# one piece of work at startup, one of the six described above, which
# they run forever.
#
# The concurrency model is that each tile runs exclusively on its own
# thread, and communicates with other tiles via. message passing.  The
# message passing primitives are built on top of shared memory, but
# tiles do not otherwise communicate via. shared memory.  These message
# queues between tiles are all fixed size, and when a producer outruns a
# downstream consumer and fills the outgoing buffer transactions will be
# dropped.

# A full Firedancer layout spins up these six tasks onto a variety of
# tiles and connects them together with queues so that data can flow in
# and out of the system with maximum throughput and minimal overruns.

# All memory that will be used in Firedancer is pre-allocated in two
# kinds of pages: huge and gigantic.  Huge pages are 2MB and gigantic
# pages are 1GB.  This is done to prevent TLB misses which can have a
# high performance cost.  There are three important steps in this
# configuration,
#
#  1. At boot time or soon after, the kernel is told to allocate a
#     certain number of both huge and gigantic pages to a special pool
#     so that they are reserved for later use by privileged programs.
#
#  2. At configuration time, one (psuedo) filesystem of type hugetlbfs
#     for each of huge and gigantic pages is mounted on a local
#     directory.  Any file created within these filesystems will be
#     backed by in-memory pages of the desired size.
#
#  3. At Firedancer initialization time, Firedancer creates a
#     "workspace" file in one of these mounts.  The workspace is a
#     single mapped memory region within which the program lays out and
#     initializes all of the data structures it will need in advance.
#     Most Firedancer allocations occur at initialization time, and this
#     memory is fully managed by special purpose allocators.

    # For enhanced security, Firedancer runs itself in a restrictive
    # sandbox in production.  The sandbox prevents most system calls and
    # restricts the capabilities of the process after initialization to
    # make the attack surface smaller.  This is required in production,
    # but might be too restrictive during development.

    # In development, you can disable the sandbox for testing and
    # debugging with the `--no-sandbox` argument to `fddev`.

    # receive packets when binding to the loopback interface.  This can

    # solution, they allow us to create a pair of virtual interfaces on
    # the machine which can route to each other.
    #
    # If this configuration is enabled, `fdctl dev` will create two
    # network namespaces and a link between them to send packets back
    # and forth.  When this option is enabled, the interface to bind to
    # in the net configuration must be one of the virtual interfaces.
    # Firedancer will be launched by `fdctl` within that namespace.
    #
    # This is a development only configuration, network namespaces are
    # not suitable for production use due to performance overhead.  In

    # with the `--netns` argument.
