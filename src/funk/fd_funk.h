/* Funk is a hybrid of a database and version control system designed
   for ultra high performance blockchain applications.

   The data model is a flat table of records.  A record is a xid/key-val
   pair and records are fast O(1) indexable by their xid/key.  xid is
   short for "transaction id" and xids have a compile time fixed size
   (e.g. 32-bytes).  keys also have a compile time fixed size (e.g.
   64-bytes).  Record values can vary in length from zero to a compile
   time maximum size.  The xid of all zeros is reserved for the "root"
   transaction described below.  Outside this, there are no
   restrictions on what a record xid, key or val can be.  Individual
   records can be created, updated, and deleted arbitrarily.  They are
   just binary data as far as funk is concerned.

   The maximum number of records is practically only limited by the size
   of the workspace memory backing it.  At present, each record requires
   160 bytes of metadata (this includes records that are published and
   records that are in the process of being updated).  In other words,
   about 15 GiB record metadata per hundred million records.  The
   maximum number of records that can be held by a funk instance is set
   when that it was created (given the persistent and relocatable
   properties described below though, it is straightforward to resize
   this).

   The transaction model is richer than what is found in a regular
   database.  A transaction is a xid-"updates to parent transaction"
   pair and transactions are fast O(1) indexable by xid.  There is no
   limitation on the number of updates in a transaction.  Updates to the
   record value are represented as the complete value record to make it
   trivial to apply cryptographic operations like hashing to all updated
   values in a transaction with file I/O, operating system calls, memory
   data marshalling overhead, etc.

   Like records, the maximum number of transactions in preparation is
   practically only limited by the size of the workspace memory backing
   it.  At present, a transaction requires 96 bytes of memory.  As such,
   it is practical to track a large number of forks during an extended
   period of time of consensus failure in a block chain application
   without using much workspace memory at all.  The maximum number of
   transactions that can be in preparation at any given time by a funk
   instance is set when that it was created (as before, given the
   persistent and relocatable properties described below, it is
   straightforward to resize this).

   That is, a transaction is a compact representation of the entire
   history of _all_ the database records up to that transaction.  We can
   trace a transaction's ancestors back to the "root" give the complete
   history of all database records up to that transaction.  The “root”
   transaction is the ancestor of all transactions.  The transaction
   history is linear from the root transaction until the "last
   published" transaction and cannot be modified.

   To start "preparing" a new transaction, we pick the new transaction's
   xid (ideally unique among all transactions thus far) and fork off a
   "parent" transaction.  This operation virtually clones all database
   records in the parent transaction, even if the parent itself has not
   yet been "published".  Given the above, the parent transaction can be
   the last published transaction or another in-preparation transaction.

   Record creates, reads, writes, erases take place within the context
   of a transaction, effectively isolating them to a private view of the
   world.  If a transaction is "cancelled", the changes to a record are
   harmlessly discarded.  Records in a transaction that has children
   cannot be changed ("frozen").

   As such, it is not possible to modify the records in transactions
   strictly before the last published transaction.  However, it is
   possible to modify the records of the last published transaction if
   there no transactions in preparation.  This is useful, for example,
   loading up a transaction from a checkpointed state on startup.  A
   common idiom at start of a block though is to fork the potential
   transaction of that block from its parent (freezing its parent) and
   then fork a child of the the potential transaction that will hold
   updates to the block that are incrementally "merged" into the
   potential transaction as block processing progresses.

   Critically, in-preparation transactions form a tree of dependent and
   competing histories.  This model matches blockchains, where
   speculative work can proceed on several blocks at once long before
   the blocks are finalized.  When a transaction is published, all its
   ancestors are also published, any competing histories are
   cancelled, leaving only a linear history up to the published
   transaction.  There is no practical limitation on the complexity of
   this tree.

   Funk tolerates applications crashing or being killed.  On a clean
   process termination, the state of the database will correspond to the
   last published transactions and all in-preparation transactions as
   they were at termination.  Extensive memory integrity checkers are
   provided to help with resuming / recovering if a code is killed
   uncleanly / crashes / etc in the middle of funk operations.  Hardware
   failures (or abrupt power loss) are not handled.  These latter
   scenarios require hardware solutions such redundant disk arrays and
   uninterruptible power supplies and/or background methods for writing
   published records to permanent storage described below.

   Under the hood, the database state is stored in NUMA and TLB
   optimized shared memory (i.e. fd_wksp) such that various database
   operations can be used concurrently by multiple threads distributed
   arbitrarily over multiple processes zero copy.

   Database operations are at algorithmic minimums with reasonably high
   performance implementations.  Most are fast O(1) time and all are
   small O(1) space (e.g. in complex transaction tree operations, there
   is no use of dynamic allocation to hold temporaries and no use of
   recursion to bound stack utilization at trivial levels).  Further,
   there are no explicit operating system calls and, given a well
   optimized workspace (i.e. the wksp pages fit within a core's TLBs) no
   implicit operating system calls.  Critical operations (e.g. those
   that actually might impact transaction history) are fortified against
   memory corruption (e.g. robust against DoS attack by corrupting
   transaction metadata to create loops in transaction trees or going
   out of bounds in memory).  Outside of record values, all memory used
   is preallocated.  And record values are O(1) lockfree concurrent
   allocated via fd_alloc using the same wksp as funk (the
   implementation is structured in layers that are straightforward to
   retarget for particular applications as might be necessary).

   The shared memory used by a funk instance is within a workspace such
   that it is also persistent and remotely inspectable.  For example, a
   process attached to a funk instance can be terminated and a new
   process can resume exactly where the original process left off
   instantly (e.g. no file I/O).  Or a real-time monitor could
   visualizing the ongoing activity in a database non-invasively (e.g.
   forks in flight, records updated by forks, etc).  Or an auxiliary
   process could be lazily and non-invasively writing all published
   records to permanent storage in the background in parallel with
   on-going operations.

   The records are further stored in the workspace memory relocatably.
   For example, workspace memory could just be committed to a persistent
   memory as is (or backed by NVMe or such directly), copied to a
   different host, and processes on the new host could resume (indeed,
   though it wouldn't be space efficient, the shared memory region is
   usable as is as an on-disk checkpoint file).  Or the workspace could
   be resized and what not to handle large needs than when the database
   was initially created and it all "just works". */

  /* The funk transaction map stores the details about transactions

     fd_map_giant and more details are given in fd_funk_txn.h

     txn_max is the maximum number of transactions that can be in
     preparation.  Due to the use of compressed map indices to reduce
     workspace memory footprint required, txn_max is at most
     FD_FUNK_TXN_IDX_NULL (currently ~4B).  This should be more than
     ample for anticipated uses cases ... e.g. every single validator in
     a pool of tens of thousands Solana validator had its own fork and
     with no consensus ever being achieved, a funk with txn_max at the
     limits of a compressed index will be chug along for days to weeks
     before running out of indexing space.  But if ever needing to
     support more, it is straightforward to change the code to not use
     index compression.  Then, a funk (with a planet sized workspace
     backing it) would survive a similar scenario for millions of years.
     Presumably, if such a situation arose, in the weeks to eons while
     there was consensus, somebody would notice and care enough to
     intervene (if not it is probably irrelevant to the real world
     anyway).

     txn_map_gaddr is the wksp gaddr of the fd_funk_txn_map_t used by

     decompression, they give the txn map index of the {oldest,youngest}

     transaction id is last_publish).  FD_FUNK_TXN_IDX_NULL indicates
     the funk is childless.  Thus, if head/tail is FD_FUNK_TXN_IDX_NULL,
