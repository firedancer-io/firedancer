   3. Otherwise, the record is copied from the ancestor transaction
   into the given transaction. This is returned in modifiable
   form. This is equivalent to fd_funk_rec_query_global,
   fd_funk_rec_insert, fd_funk_val_copy, and fd_funk_rec_modify.

   In all cases, the record is grown to min_val_size if it is less
   than this size, padding with zeros if necessary.

   The irec argument is the previous incarnation of the record if
   known (i.e. the result of fd_funk_rec_query_global( funk, txn, key
   ) ). This allows the elimination of the query in some cases. Use
   NULL if this value is unavailable. */
