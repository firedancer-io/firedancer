/* fd_aio defines a simple abstraction for asynchronous sending and
   receiving packets.  It abstracts away many details so the same code
   can work performant and transparent with different low level I/O
   libraries and hardware.

   FIXME: update the below documentation.  Also, given fd_aio_t almostly
   certainly is behaves like an abstract base class, doing a declaration
   like the below for a fd_aio_t is probably wrong because different
   implementations likely will need different footprints and the like
   long term.

   ### Example: Setup

     fd_quic_t * quic = get_quic(); // get an initialized quic instance
     fd_xdp_t *  xdp  = get_xdp();  // get an initialized xdp instance

     fd_aio_t aio_xdp_to_quic;
     fd_aio_t aio_quic_to_xdp;

     fd_quic_set_aio( quic, aio_xdp_to_quic, aio_quic_to_xdp );
     fd_xdp_set_aio ( xdp, aio_quic_to_xdp,  aio_xdp_to_quic );

     // the two *set_aio calls have the following effect:
     //   aio_xdp_to_quic.recv = fd_aio_cb_receive;
     //   aio_xdp_to_quic.ctx  = quic;

     //   aio_quic_to_xdp.recv = fd_xdp_aio_cb_receive;
     //   aio_quic_to_xdp.ctx  = xdp;

     // now whenever fd_quic_process is called on quic, quic will
     // be able to send data to xdp via fd_aio_send(...)
     // and vice versa

   ### Example: Sending

     fd_aio_t aio;

     aio.recv = my_cb_receive;
     aio.ctx   quic;

     fd_aio_pkt_info_t batch[10] = {{ .data = data, .data_sz = data_sz }};

     fd_aio_pkt_info_t cur_batch    = batch;
     ulong         cur_batch_sz = 10;
     while( cur_batch_sz ) {
       int send_rc = fd_aio_send( aio, cur_batch, cur_batch_sz ); // send a batch of buffers to the peer
       if( send_rc < 0 ) {
         fprintf( stderr, "error occurred during send\n" );
         break;
       }
       cur_batch    += send_rc;
       cur_batch_sz -= send_rc;

       // possibly do some other process that might free up resources
       // to avoid deadlock
     } */

/* FD_AIO_SUCCESS, FD_AIO_ERR_* give a number of integer error codes
   used by AIO operations.  FD_AIO_ERR_* will be negative integers.

/* A fd_aio_send_func_t is used to tell an AIO instance to do a best
   effort packet batch send.  Unless otherwise noted by a specific API
   or implementation:

   - The AIO instance will queue up, in order, the given packet batch
     for transmission.  Packets in the batch are indexed in
     [0,batch_cnt) and info about the packet to transmit is in
     batch[idx].

   - batch[idx].buf_sz==0 (and, if so, possibly batch[idx].buf==NULL) is
     valid.  It will be treated as successfully transmitted and
     otherwise ignored.

   - batch_cnt==0 is a valid and returns success immediately.

   - There is no restriction on the packet buffers used by the send
     function.  For example, specifying the same buffer multiple times
     in the batch and/or using overlapping buffers in the batch are
     valid.

   - On success, this will return zero (FD_AIO_SUCCESS) and
     opt_batch_idx will be ignored.

   - If an error occurs, this will return a negative error code
     (FD_AIO_ERR_*).

   - If an error occurs and opt_batch_idx is non-NULL, *opt_batch_idx
     will contain the index of the first packet in the batch that was
     not "sent" from the caller's POV.

   - As such, in this case, all packets indexed [0,*opt_batch_idx) will
     have been "sent" from the caller's POV and those in
     [*opt_batch_idx,batch_cnt) were not.

   - Further, in this case and the error reason is specific to a packet,
     packets indexed [0,*opt_batch_idx) were seemingly transmissable,
     the packet indexed *opt_batch_idx was untransmissable and packets
     indexed (*opt_batch_idx,batch_cnt) had unexamined transmissability.

   - The batch array and memory regions covered by the batch array and
     any *opt_batch_idx must not be modified while this is running.
     The batch array itself and the memory regions referred to by the
     batch array are not modified by this function.  The AIO retains no
     interest in the batch array, the packet buffers referred to in the
     array on return.

   Note the reception of any packets "sent" by this call is not
   guaranteed.  Reasons for failed reception could include local AIO
   instance failures not diagnosable at time of call and/or failures,
   for whatever reason, in the connectivity between the sender and
   receiver.  Likewise, though the AIO will send packets in the order
   specified, it there is no general guarantee they will be received in
   any particular order (within this batch or between batches). */
