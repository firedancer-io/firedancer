/* fd_tls_estate_srv contains compressed TLS server handshake state
   while waiting for the client to send a message.  estate is optimized
   for small memory use for incoming conns (128 byte per handshake).
   (Once the peer responds, spawns an istate and queues asynchronous
   processing)

   *** Security ********************************************************

   fd_tls servers must handle handshake requests from untrusted clients,
   and thus require hardening.  A typical lifetime of an estate object
   is in the order of ~3 seconds (conn timeout).  This requires some
   care to avoid memory exhaustion attacks.

   For example, a default OpenSSL app uses a handshake state size of
   about 10 KB (via multiple allocations on global heap).  Assuming 3
   second conn timeout, and flood rate of 1 million ClientHello msg/s,
   an attacker could indefinitely occupy ~30 GB of raw heap allocations!
   More concerning -- Global heap pressure will cause latent allocation
   failures in unrelated code, which might escalate to OOM kills.

   fd_tls_estate would only require 0.38 GB of memory for the same spam
   rate.  The memory of estate_srv objects is provided by the transport
   layer (e.g. QUIC or TLS record layer).  Each estate_srv object has
   static footprint.  This allows dense packing in custom memory arenas.

   This allows for robust handling of packet floods:  Even in the event
   the estate_srv arena is exhausted, the impact is limited to temporary
   inability to accept new connections.  Processing of established conns
   and unrelated code is unaffected.

   *** State Machine ***************************************************

   Each estate_srv object corresponds to an instance of a server-side
   TLS handshake state machine.  It is first instantiated when the
   client sent its ClientHello, the first message of a TLS handshake.

   Currently, only one external state exists:

     FD_TLS_HS_WAIT_FINISHED:  Processed ClientHello.

       At this point, the server has responded with all messages up to
       server Finished and is waiting for the client to respond with
       with client Finished (and optionally, a certificate).

   State data contains:

   - The transcript hash state, which commits both sides to the entire
     sequence of handshake messages (such that they cannot be tampered
     with).

   - The client handshake secret, which is used to derive the "client
     Finished" verify data. */
