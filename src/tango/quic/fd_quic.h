/* fd_quic_t is an implementation of QUIC -- an encrypted, multiplexing
   transport layer network protocol.

   For now, IPv4 over Ethernet (EN10MB) flows are supported.

   This API is non-blocking and single-threaded.  Any requests to the
   peer (such as "open a connection") are queued and processed on RX
   or service call.  The user is notified of events via callbacks.
   The user must further ensure that RX (via fd_aio_t) is dispatched
   only from the thread with the active join to the target fd_quic_t.

   Scaling is achieved via fd_quic_t instances and steering of RX flows.
   For example, incoming RX that exceeds the throughput of one fd_quic_t
   may be load balanced based on QUIC dest conn ID, or UDP src flow ID.

   This implementation aims to be compliant to RFC 9000 and RFC 9001:

   - https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9001

   ### Memory Management

   fd_quic is almost entirely pre-allocated (with the exception of
   OpenSSL objects).  Currently, a QUIC object reserves space for a
   number of connection slots, with uniform stream, reassembly, and ACK
   buffers.

   ### Memory Layout

   fd_quic_t is the publicly exported memory layout of a QUIC object.
   The private memory region of a QUIC object extends beyond the end of
   this struct.  fd_quic_t is not intended to be allocated directly,
   refer to the below for details.

   ### Lifecycle

   The below state diagram shows the lifecycle of an fd_quic_t.

   ### Lifecycle: Allocation & Formatting

   A QUIC object resides in a contiguous pre-allocated memory region.
   (Usually, in a Firedancer workspace)  The footprint and internal
   layout depends on the pre-configured fd_quic_limits_t parameters.
   These limits are constant throughout the lifetime of an fd_quic_t.

   Use fd_quic_{align,footprint} to determine size and alignment of the
   memory region to be used.  Use fd_quic_new to format such a memory
   region and to obtain an opaque handle.  In the formatted state, the
   fd_quic_t is position-independent (may be mapped at different virtual
   addresses).  This is useful for separating allocation and runtime use
   into different steps.

   ### Lifecycle: Joining

   Given an opaque handle, fd_quic_join runs basic coherence checks and
   returns a typed pointer to the object.  The object is not modified
   by this operation.  Each object may have multiple active joins, but
   only one of them may write.  (Typically, a single join is used for
   service, and secondary joins for read-only monitoring)

   ### Lifecycle: Usage

   fd_quic_init initializes an fd_quic_t for use.  On success, the QUIC
   becomes ready to serve from the thread that init was called from (it
   is invalid to service QUIC from another thread). */
