/* Userspace API for controlling the fd_xdp_redirect_prog program.

   ### XDP program

   This API is specific to the fd_xdp_redirect_prog.c program.
   Loading other XDP programs is unsupported.  In short, it is
   responsible for identifying and redirecting packets matching the
   app's listener to the app's XSKs (e.g. by IP address/UDP port).
   See the program's source for more info.

   ### XDP program installation

   The bpf(2) syscall allows loading a compiled eBPF program into the
   kernel.  It is recommended to enable the eBPF JIT compiler for better
   performance via `echo 1 >/proc/sys/net/core/bpf_jit_enable`.
   Manpage: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/bpf.2.html

   ### Lifecycle

   This API allows separating the XDP program installation from the app
   lifecycle, reducing the privileges/capabilities required at runtime.

   The step-by-step lifecycle looks as follows:

   - fd_xdp_install() (privileged)
   - For each interface to listen on
     - fd_xdp_hook_iface() (privileged)
     - For each RX/TX queue pair of this interface
       - fd_xsk_new()
       - fd_xsk_bind()
       - fd_xsk_join()
   - For each UDP/IP destination to listen on
     - fd_xdp_listen_udp_port()
   - ... Application run ... */
