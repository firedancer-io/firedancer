/* fd_xsk manages an XSK file descriptor and provides RX/TX buffers.

   ### Background

   AF_XDP is a Linux API providing kernel-bypass networking in the form
   of shared memory ring buffers accessible from userspace.  The kernel
   redirects packets from/to these buffers with the appropriate XDP
   configuration (XDP_REDIRECT).  AF_XDP is hardware-agnostic and allows
   sharing a NIC with the Linux networking stack (unlike e.g. DPDK).
   This allows for deployment in existing, heterogeneous networks. An
   AF_XDP socket is called "XSK".  The shared memory region storing the
   packet data flowing through an XSK is called "UMEM".

   XDP (eXpress Data Path) is a framework for installing hooks in the
   form of eBPF programs at an early stage of packet processing (i.e.
   before tc and netfilter).  eBPF is user-deployable JIT-compiled
   bytecode that usually runs inside the kernel. Some hardware/driver
   combinations optionally allow offloading eBPF processing to NICs.
   This is not to be confused with other BPF-erived ISAs such as sBPF
   (Solana BPF).

   Figure 1 shows a simplified block diagram of RX packet flow within
   the kernel in `XDP_FLAGS_DRV_MODE` mode.  Notably, the chain of eBPF
   programs installed in the XDP facility get invoked for every incoming
   packet.  If all programs return the `XDP_PASS` action, the packet
   continues its usual path to the Linux networking stack, where it will
   be allocated in sk_buff, and eventually flow through ip_rcv(), tc,
   and netfilter before reaching downstream sockets.
   If the `XDP_REDIRECT` action is taken however, the packet is copied
   to the UMEM of an XSK, and a RX queue entry is allocated.  An fd_aio
   backend is provided by fd_xdp_aio.
   The more generic `XDP_FLAGS_SKB_MODE` XDP mode falls back to sk_buff-
   based memory mgmt (still skipping the rest of the generic path), but
   is more widely available.

   Figure 2 shows a simplified block diagram of the TX packet flow.
   Userspace applications deliver packets to the XSK/UMEM buffers.  The
   kernel then forwards these packets to the NIC.  This also means that
   the application is responsible for maintaining a routing table to
   resolve layer-3 dest addrs to NICs and layer-2 addrs.  As in the RX
   flow, netfilter (iptables, nftables) is not available.

   ### Memory Management

   The UMEM area is allocated from userspace.  It is recommended to use
   the fd_util shmem/wksp APIs to obtain large page-backed memory.  UMEM
   is divided into equally sized frames. At any point in time, each
   frame is either owned by userspace or the kernel.  On initialization,
   all frames are owned by userspace.

   Changes in UMEM frame ownership and packet RX/TX events are
   transmitted via four rings allocated by the kernel (mmap()ed in by
   the user). This allows for out-of-order processing of packets.

      Data flow:
      (U->K) is userspace-to-kernel communication, and
      (K->U) is kernel-to-userspace.

      FILL         Free frames are provided to the kernel using the FILL
      (U->K)       ring. The kernel may populate these frames with RX
                   packet data.

      RX           Once the kernel has populated a FILL frame with RX
      (K->U)       packet data, it passes back the frame to userspace
                   via the RX queue.

      TX           TX frames sent by userspace are provided to the
      (U->K)       kernel using the TX ring.

      COMPLETION   Once the kernel has processed a TX frame, it passes
      (K->U)       back the frame to the userspace via the COMPLETION
                   queue.

   Combined, the FILL-RX and TX-COMPLETION rings form two pairs.  The
   kernel will not move frames between the pairs. */
