init [WKSP] [PERM] [USER] [GROUP]
- Prepare an XDP environment by pinning the XDP redirect
  program and associated eBPF maps in /sys/fs/bpf/[WKSP].
  All kernel OS resources allocated by fd_xdp_ctl will be
  local to their [WKSP], allowing for multiple installations
  on the same machine.
- /sys/fs/bpf must be a valid bpffs mount.
- Creates the following files:
  /sys/fs/bpf/[WKSP]/udp_dsts  eBPF map of UDP/IP listen addrs
- Must be re-run after each reboot.
- Requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN, see capabilities(7).
- /sys/fs/bpf and /sys/fs/bpf/[WKSP] are updated with
  permission bits in [PERM] and set to owner [USER]:[GROUP].
  Empty strings for [USER] are [GROUP] use current user
  defaults.  A typical use case is
  'init firedancer 0700 $(whoami) ""'

fini [WKSP]
- Destroy all kernel resources installed by fd_xdp_ctl app
  [WKSP] including any XDP programs and eBPF maps.
- Requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN, see capabilities(7).

hook-iface [WKSP] [IFACE] [XDP_MODE]
- Install the XDP redirect program to the network device
  [IFACE]. The XDP installation mode [XDP_MODE] can be one of
  "skb" (supported on all hardware), "drv" (requires driver
  support), "hw" (requires NIC hardware support).
- Any XDP program previously installed by fd_xdp_ctl will be
  replaced. Other XDP programs are left intact.
- Creates the following files:
  /sys/fs/bpf/[WKSP]/[IFACE]/xdp   Link to BPF_PROG_TYPE_XDP
  /sys/fs/bpf/[WKSP]/[IFACE]/xsks  BPF_MAP_TYPE_XSKMAP
- Must be re-run after each reboot.
- Requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN, see capabilities(7).

unhook-iface [WKSP] [IFACE]
- Remove an installation of the XDP program created by
  fd_xdp_ctl add-iface [IFACE]. No-op if no such XDP
  program is present on the given interface.
- Requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN, see capabilities(7).

listen-udp-port [WKSP] [IP_ADDR] [UDP_PORT] [PROTO]
- Install listener for protocol [PROTO] on IP destination
  address [IP_ADDR] and UDP destination port [UDP_PORT].
  [IP_ADDR] must be an IPv4 address in the form of "x.y.z.w".
  [UDP_PORT] must be a decimal integer in [0;65536).
  On interfaces running the XDP redirect program, redirects
  matching packets to active XSKs in [WKSP].
  If no XSK matches, the affected traffic will be dropped.
  Fails if a listener installed by fd_xdp_ctl is already
  registered on this port.
- Redirected traffic will not reach other OS network facilities
  such as lower-priority XDP programs or AF_INET sockets.
- Valid values for [PROTO]:
  - gossip: Solana Gossip protocol
  - tpu-udp-user: User txn requests via TPU/UDP
  - tpu-quic-user: User txn requests via TPU/QUIC
  - tpu-quic-vote: Vote txn requests via TPU/QUIC
  - tvu: Turbine shred stream
- Requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN, see capabilities(7).

release-udp-port [WKSP] [IP_ADDR] [UDP_PORT]
- Uninstall listener on [IP_ADDR]:[UDP_PORT].
  XSKs bound to the eBPF program with the given pin-dir will
  no longer receive packets with the given UDP destination
  port. Any other sockets listening on this UDP port will start
  to receive packets again.
- Requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN, see capabilities(7).

new-xsk [WKSP] [FRAME_SZ] [RX_DEPTH] [TX_DEPTH]
- Create a new XSK buffer in [WKSP] with the given frame size
  [FRAME_SZ], RX/Fill queue depth [RX_DEPTH], and TX/Completion
  queue depth [TX_DEPTH].
- The value of [FRAME_SZ] is restricted by the Linux kernel.
  As of Linux 4.18, valid values include 2048 and 4096.
- Prints the wksp gaddr of the xdp to stdout.

bind-xsk [WKSP:GADDR] [WKSP] [IFACE] [IFACE_QUEUE]
- Bind the XSK buffer identified by [WKSP:GADDR] to network
  device [IFACE] on queue number [IFACE_QUEUE].
- Note that does not create any XSK file descriptors at the
  time of running this command. XSK fds are created and
  assigned to this buffer by the receiving tile at runtime.
- As RSS (receive side scaling) is not supported for all
  protocols yet (e.g. QUIC), each queue of an interface should
  be bound to an XSK. This is because the kernel cannot
  redirect a packet to an XSK bound to a different RX queue
  than a packet arrives on, and without RSS, packets will
  arrive at arbitrary queues depending on NIC configuration.
  Failure to bind at least one XSK for each active iface queue
  will result in packet loss.
- The eBPF program installation done in hook-iface must use
  the same [WKSP] as bind-xsk.

unbind-xsk [WKSP:GADDR]
- Unbinds the XSK buffer identified by [WKSP:GADDR] from a network
  device queue. No XSK fd may be assigned to this buffer at the time of
  running this command.

delete-xsk [WKSP:GADDR]
- Deletes the XSK buffer at [WKSP:GADDR]. No XSK fd may be
  assigned to this buffer at the time of running this command.

new-xsk-aio [WKSP] [TX_DEPTH] [BATCH_CNT]
- Creates a new XSK fd_aio driver in [WKSP] with the given
  TX/Completion queue depth [TX_DEPTH] and the given aio batch
  depth [BATCH_CNT].

delete-xsk-aio [WKSP:GADDR]
- Destroys the XSK fd_aio driver at [WKSP:GADDR].
