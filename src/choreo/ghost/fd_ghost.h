/* fd_ghost implements Solana's LMD-GHOST ("latest message-driven greedy
   heaviest-observed subtree") fork choice rule.

   Protocol details:

   - LMD is an acronym for "latest message-driven".  It describes how
     votes are counted when picking the best fork.  In this scheme, only
     a validator's latest vote counts.  So if a validator votes for slot
     3 and then slot 5, the vote for 5 overwrites the vote for 3.

   - GHOST is an acronym for "greedy heaviest-observed subtree":

     greedy:   for each depth of the tree, pick the locally optimal
               child / subtree / fork.  This will result in the global
               optimal choice.

     heaviest: pick based on the highest stake weight.

     observed: this is the validator's local view, and other validators
               may have differing views because they've observed
               different votes.

     subtree:  pick based on the weight of an entire subtree, not just
               an individual ele.  For example, if slot 3 has 10 stake
               and slot 5 has 5 stake, but slot 5 has two children 6
               and 7 that each have 3 stake, our weights are

               slot 3 subtree [3]        = 10
               slot 5 subtree [5, 6, 7]  = 11 (5+3+3)

               Therefore slot 5 would be the heaviest.

   In-memory representation:

   There are two maps, both indexing the same pool of tree elements.

   - One map is keyed by slot number, and one map is keyed by hash_id
     (currently the block id, which is the merkle root of the last FEC
     set in the slot).

   - The elements in the slot map are a subset of the elements in the
     hash_id map.

   - Each tree ele tracks the amount of stake (`stake`) that has voted
     for its slot, as well as the recursive sum of stake for the subtree
     rooted at that ele (`weight`).

   The map keyed by slot is the "happy tree."  i.e. the first version of
   a block we see and replay is going to be the version visible in the
   slot map.  This is also the version of the slot that our tower is
   referring to.  The map keyed by hash_id maintains every block that
   we've seen evidence of, including the equivocating blocks.

   both equivocating blocks seen             only one block seen

              0                                      0
             / \                                    /
            1   1' (both invalid)                  1' (valid)
           /     \                                /
          2       3                              3

   The first version of block 1 we see / replay is going to be the
   version visible in the slot map.  Block 1' will be available in the
   hash-keyed tree, but not in the slot map.  Block 3 will also be
   available in the slot-keyed tree, despite being a descendant of
   something not existing in the slot map.

   Thus in ghost,

   both equivocating blocks seen             only one block seen
   slot_map: [0, 1, 2, 3]                    slot_map: [0, 1', 3]
   hash_map: [1']                            hash_map: []

   Whatever is in the slot map is the slot referenced to by tower. Tower
   is *pure* and has no notion of duplicitness.  So tower just needs to
   worry about querying ghost_slot_map for the proper hash_id.

   Slot 4 arrives, chained off of 1.  In the right case where we didn't
   see block 1, block 4 now provides evidence for 1.  We mark 1' as
   invalid for fork choice, and we repair the parent of 4 (getting 1').
   Then we replay down 1' and then replay down 4.  Now the maps in this
   case look like:

   both equivocating blocks seen             only one block seen

              0                                      0
             / \                                    / \
            1   1' (both invalid)                  1'   1 (both invalid)
           / \   \                                /      \
          2   4   3                              3        4

   both equivocating blocks seen             only one block seen
   slot_map: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]                 slot_map: [0, 1', 3, 4]
   hash_map: [1']                            hash_map: [1']

   Let's say 1' get's duplicate confirmed.  Then the left case needs to
   switch forks in tower.  Then ghost will need to itself swap the
   corresponding ghost hash_id in the slot_map to the hash_map and vice
   versa.

   both equivocating blocks seen             only one block seen
   slot_map: [0, 1', 2, 3, 4]                slot_map: [0, 1', 3, 4]
   hash_map: [1]                             hash_map: [1']
                                             (no change)

   1' is marked as valid for fork choice.  1 remains invalid.

   ```
   fd_ghost_ele_t const * ele = fd_ghost_query( slot );
   fd_ghost_print( ghost, fd_ghost_parent( fd_ghost_parent( ele ) ) )
