/* Tower implements Solana's TowerBFT algorithm.

   Starting with some intuition, the goal of TowerBFT is for a
   supermajority of the validator cluster to pick the same fork. As we
   know, we receive and execute blocks during replay.

        /-- 3-- 4 (A)
   1-- 2
        \-- 5 (B)

   Here, is a diagram of a fork. The leader for slot 5 decided to build
   off slot 2, rather than slot 4. This can happen for various reasons,
   for example network propagation delay. We now have two possible forks
   labeled A and B. The consensus algorithm has to pick one of them.

   So, how does the consensus algorithm pick? As detailed in fd_ghost.h,
   we pick the fork based on the most stake from votes, called the
   “heaviest”. Validators vote for blocks during replay, and
   simultaneously use other validator’s votes to determine which block
   to vote for. This encourages convergence, because as one fork gathers
   more votes, more and more votes pile on, solidifying its position as
   the heaviest fork.

         /-- 3-- 4 (10%)
   1-- 2
         \-- 5 (9%)

   However, network propagation delay of votes can lead us to think one
   fork is heaviest, before observing new votes that indicate another
   fork is heavier. So our consensus algorithm also needs to support
   switching.

         /-- 3-- 4 (10%)
   1-- 2
         \-- 5 (15%)

   At the same time we don’t want excessive switching. The more often
   validators switch, the more difficult it will be to achieve that pile
   on effect I just described.

   Note that to switch forks, you need to rollback a given slot and its
   descendants on that fork. In the example above, to switch to 1, 2, 5,
   we need to rollback 3 and 4. The consensus algorithm makes it more
   costly the further you want to rollback a fork. Here, I’ve added a
   column lockout, which doubles for every additional slot you want to
   rollback.

   Eventually you have traversed far enough down a fork, that the
   lockout is so great it is infeasible to imagine it ever rolling back
   in practice. So you can make that fork permanent or “commit” it. Once
   all validators do this, the blockchain now just has a single fork.

   Armed with some intuition, now let’s begin defining some terminology.
   Here is a diagram of a validator's "vote tower":

   slot | confirmation count (conf)
   --------------------------------
   4    | 1
   3    | 2
   2    | 3
   1    | 4

   It is a stack structure in which each element is a vote. The vote
   slot column indicates which slots the validator has voted for,
   ordered from most to least recent.

   The confirmation count column indicates how many consecutive votes on
   the same fork have been pushed on top of that vote. You are
   confirming your own votes for a fork every time you vote on top of
   the same fork.

   Two related concepts to confirmation count are lockout and expiration
   slot. Lockout equals 2 to the power of confirmation count. Every time
   we “confirm” a vote by voting on top of it, we double the lockout.
   The expiration slot is the sum of vote slot and lockout, so it also
   increases when lockouts double. It represents which slot the vote
   will expire. When a vote expires, it is popped from the top of the
   tower. An important Tower rule is that a validator cannot vote for a
   different fork from a given vote slot, until reaching the expiration
   slot for that vote slot. To summarize, the further a validator wants
   to rollback their fork (or vote slots) the longer the validator needs
   to wait without voting (in slot time).

   Here is the same tower, fully-expanded to include all the fields:

   slot | conf | lockout | expiration
   ----------------------------------
   4    | 1    | 2       | 6
   3    | 2    | 4       | 7
   2    | 3    | 8       | 10
   1    | 4    | 16      | 17

   Based on this tower, the validator is locked out from voting for any
   slot <= 6 that is on a different fork than slot 4. I’d like to
   emphasize that the expiration is with respect to the vote slot, and
   is _not_ related to the Proof-of-History slot or what the
   quote-unquote current slot is. So even if the current slot is now 7,
   the validator can’t go back and vote for slot 5, if slot 5 were on a
   different fork than 4. The earliest valid vote slot this validator
   could submit for a different fork from 4 would be slot 7 or later.

   Next let’s look at how the tower makes state transitions. Here we
   have the previous example tower, with a before-and-after view with
   respect to a vote for slot 9:

             slot | conf
   (before)  -----------
             4    | 1
             3    | 2
             2    | 3
             1    | 4

            slot | conf
   (after)  -----------
            9    | 1
            2    | 3
            1    | 4

   As you can see, we added a vote for slot 9 to the top of the tower.
   But we also removed the votes for slot 4 and slot 3. What happened?
   This is an example of vote expiry in action. When we voted for slot
   9, this exceeded the expirations of vote slots 4 and 3, which were 6
   and 7 respectively. This action of voting triggered the popping of
   the expired votes from the top of the tower.

   Next, we add a vote for slot 11:

             slot | conf
   (before)  -----------
             9    | 1
             2    | 3
             1    | 4

             slot | conf
   (after)   -----------
             11   | 1
             9    | 2
             2    | 3
             1    | 4

   The next vote for slot 11 doesn’t involve expirations, so we just add
   it to the top of the tower. Also, here is an important property of
   lockouts. Note that the lockout for vote slot 9 doubled (ie. the
   confirmation count increased by 1) but the lockouts of vote slots 2
   and 1 remained unchanged.

   The reason for this is confirmation counts only increase when they
   are consecutive in the vote tower. Because 4 and 3 were expired
   previously by the vote for 9, that consecutive property was broken.
   In this case, the vote for slot 11 is only consecutive with slot 9,
   but not 2 and 1. Specifically, there is a gap in the before-tower at
   confirmation count 2.

   In the after-tower, all the votes are again consecutive (confirmation
   counts 1, 2, 3, 4 are all accounted for), so the next vote will
   result in all lockouts doubling as long as it doesn’t result in more
   expirations.

   One other thing I’d like to point out about this vote for slot 11.
   Even though 11 exceeds the expiration slot of vote slot 2, which is
   10, voting for 11 did not expire the vote for 2. This is because
   expiration happens top-down and contiguously. Because vote slot 9 was
   not expired, we do not proceed with expiring 2.

   In the Tower rules, once a vote reaches a max lockout of 32, it is
   considered rooted and it is popped from the bottom of the tower. Here
   is an example:

             slot | conf
   (before)  -----------
             50   | 1
             ...  | ... <- 29 votes elided
             1    | 4

             slot | conf
   (after)  -----------
             53   | 1
             ...  | ... <- 29 votes elided
             1    | 4


   So the tower is really a double-ended queue rather than a stack.

   Rooting has implications beyond the Tower. It's what we use to prune
   our state. Every time tower makes a new root slot, we prune any old
   state that does not originate from that new root slot. Our blockstore
   will discard blocks below that root, our forks structure will discard
   stale banks, funk (which is our accounts database) will discard stale
   transactions (which in turn track modifications to accounts), and
   ghost (which is our fork select tree) will discard stale nodes
   tracking stake percentages. We call this operation publishing.

   Note that the vote slots are not necessarily consecutive. Here I
   elided the votes sandwiched between the newest and oldest votes for
   brevity.

   Next, let’s go over three additional tower checks. These three checks
   further reinforce the consensus algorithm we established with
   intuition, in this case getting a supermajority (ie. 2/3) of stake to
   converge on a fork.

   The first is the threshold check. The threshold check makes sure at
   least 2/3 of stake has voted for the same fork as the vote at depth 8
   in our tower. Essentially, this guards our tower from getting too out
   of sync with the rest of the cluster. If we get too out of sync we
   can’t vote for a long time, because we had to rollback a vote we had
   already confirmed many times and had a large lockout. This might
   otherwise happen as the result of a network partition where we can
   only communicate with a subset of stake.

   Next is the lockout check. We went in detail on this earlier when
   going through the lockout and expiration slot, and as before, the
   rule is we can only vote on a slot for a different fork from a
   previous vote, after that vote’s expiration slot.

   Given this fork and tower from earlier:

        /-- 3-- 4
   1-- 2
        \-- 5

   slot | conf
   -----------
   4    | 1
   3    | 2
   2    | 3
   1    | 4

  You’re locked out from voting for 5 because it’s on a different fork
  from 4 and the expiration slot of your previous vote for 4 is 6.

  However, if we introduce a new slot 9:

        /-- 3-- 4
  1-- 2
        \-- 5-- 9

  slot | conf
  -----------
  9    | 1
  2    | 3
  1    | 4

  Here the new Slot 9 descends from 5, and exceeds vote slot 2’s
  expiration slot of 6 unlike 5.

  After your lockout expires, the tower rules allow you to vote for
  descendants of the fork slot you wanted to switch to in the first
  place (here, 9 descending from 5). So we eventually switch to the fork
  we wanted, by voting for 9 and expiring 3 and 4.

  Importantly, notice that the fork slots and vote slots are not exactly
  1-to-1. While conceptually our tower is voting for the fork 1, 2, 5,
  9, the vote for 5 is only implied. Our tower votes themselves still
  can’t include 5 due to lockout.

   Finally, the switch check. The switch check is used to safeguard
   optimistic confirmation. I won’t go into detail on optimistic
   confirmation, but in a nutshell it enables a fast-fork compared to
   rooting for a client to have high confidence a slot will eventually
   get rooted.

   The switch check is additional to the lockout check. Before switching
   forks, we need to make sure at least 38% of stake has voted for a
   different fork than our own. Different fork is defined by finding the
   greatest common ancestor of our last voted fork slot and the slot we
   want to switch to. Any forks descending from the greatest common
   ancestor (which I will subsequently call the GCA) that are not our own
   fork are counted towards the switch check stake.

   Here we visualize the switch check:

             /-- 7
        /-- 3-- 4
  1-- 2  -- 6
        \-- 5-- 9

   First, we find the GCA of 4 and 9 which is 2. Then we look at all the
   descendants of the GCA that do not share a fork with us, and make
   sure their stake sums to more than 38%.

   I’d like to highlight that 7 here is not counted towards the switch
   proof, even though it is on a different fork from 4. This is because
   it’s on the same fork relative to the GCA.

   Now let’s switch gears from theory back to practice. What does it
   mean to send a vote?

   As a validator, you aren’t sending individual tower votes. Rather,
   you are sending your entire updated tower to the cluster every time.
   Essentially, the validator is continuously syncing their local tower
   with the cluster. That tower state is then stored inside a vote
   account, like any other state on Solana.

   On the flip side, we also must sync the other way: from cluster to
   local. If we have previously voted, we need to make sure we’re
   starting from where the cluster thinks we last left off. Conveniently
   Funk, our accounts database, stores all the vote accounts including
   our own, so on bootstrap we simply load in our vote account state
   itself to to initialize our own local view of the tower.

   What's the difference between TowerBFT and the Vote Program?

   TowerBFT runs on the sending side against our own tower ("local"
   view). It updates the tower with votes based on the algorithm
   detailed above. Importantly, TowerBFT has a view of all forks, and
   the validator makes a voting decision based on all forks.

   The Vote Program runs on the receiving side against others' towers
   ("cluster" view). It checks that invariants about TowerBFT are
   maintained on votes received from the cluster. These checks are
   comparatively superficial to all the rules in tower. Furthermore,
   given it is a native program, the Vote Program only has access to the
   limited state programs are subject to. Specifically, it only has a
   view of the current fork it is executing on. It can't determine
   things like how much stake is allocated to other forks. */
