/* fd_notar is an API for notarizing blockswhen they reach key stake
   thresholds from votes.  Solana calls them "confirmation levels", and
   they are as follows:

   - propagation confirmed:Â a block is propagated if it has received
     votes from at least 1/3 of stake in the cluster.  This threshold is
     important for the leader pipeline, which ensures a previous leader
     block has propagated before producing the next one.  It is also
     used when voting, as we do not vote for forks in which our last
     leader block failed to propagate.

   - duplicate confirmed: a block is duplicate confirmed if it has
     received votes from at least 52% of stake in the cluster.  The
     "duplicate" adjective is a bit of a misnomer, and a more accurate
     technical term is equivocation: two (or more) different blocks for
     the same slot.  This threshold is important for consensus safety,
     because it ensures Solana eventually converges to a single block
     per slot.

   - optimistically confirmed: a block is optimistically confirmed it
     has received votes from at least 2/3 of stake in the cluster.  This
     threshold is important for end-users, who rely on the "confirmed"
     commitment status of blocks (queryable via RPC) to determine that
     their transaction has landed on a block that will not rollback.

   The reason both fd_ghost and fd_notar exist even though they do
   seemingly similar things (summing vote stakes for different slots) is
   because Solana implements the rules quite differently.

   In fd_ghost, we use the GHOST rule to recursively sum the stake of
   the subtree (a slot and all its descendants).  The LMD rule counts a
   validator's stake to at most one fork.  When the validator switches
   forks, their stake is subtracted from the old fork and added to the
   new fork.  The tree is then traversed as part of fork choice to find
   the best leaf ("head").

   In fd_notar, we sum votes towards only the block itself, and not its
   ancestors, and also a validator's stake can be counted towards
   multiple blocks at the same time if they vote on a fork then switch
   to a different one.  There is also no tree traversal, and the output
   is simply confirmed notifications.

   fd_ghost also makes fork choice decision purely based on replay votes
   whereas fd_notar's confirmation is based on both gossip and replay
   votes (fd_ghost does use gossip votes for marking forks valid or
   invalid for fork choice though). */

   predates block_ids) and maps slots to bank hashes during replay.
