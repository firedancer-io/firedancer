# [Firedancer](https://jumpcrypto.com/firedancer/) ðŸ”¥ðŸ’ƒ

Firedancer is a new validator client for Solana.

* **Fast** Designed from the ground up to be *fast*. The concurrency
model is borrowed from the low latency trading space, and the code
contains many novel high performance reimplementations of core Solana
primitives.
* **Secure** The architecture of the validator allows it to run almost
completely in user space with a highly restrictive sandbox.
* **Independent** Firedancer is a new implementation of a Solana
validator client, written from scratch. This brings client diversity to
the Solana network and helps it stay resilient to supply chain attacks
in build tooling or dependencies.

## Installation

Firedancer is currently under heavy development and is not ready for
production use. There are no releases available.

## Developing

The [getting started](doc/getting-started.md) guide has detailed system
setup instructions.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/firedancer-io/firedancer.git
$ cd firedancer
$ ./deps.sh
$ make -j
```

## Running

Firedancer uses several privileged operating system features to improve
performance and security. These can be configured manually in your
environment, but we also have a command line utility `fdctl` that lets a
user set up and tear down the environment easily.

```bash
$ cargo run configure all init # Configure required system knobs
$ cargo run run # Run the Firedancer program
```

When done, the environment can be returned to normal.

```bash
$ cargo run configure all check # Check if the system is configured correctly
$ cargo run configure all fini # Remove any special configuration we installed
```

`fdctl` reads from a  `FIREDANCER_CONFIG_TOML` environment variable to
determine all options needed in configuring and running the program. A
complete list of configuration options is provided in
[default.toml](src/app/fdctl/config/default.toml)

Some of the privileged system configuration steps performed by `fdctl`
are,

* **Huge pages** Memory needed for Firedancer must be pre-allocated
before launching it. Firedancer uses `huge` and `gigantic` memory pages,
which are mounted in a local directory. Enabling huge pages and mounting
them to a pseudo filesystem requires root privileges.
* **XDP** Kernel bypass is used for networking, via the eXpress Data
Path. Installing the packet filtering code into the driver requires a
privileged process, and must be done before running Firedancer. You may
also need to configure the network driver to support multiple channels,
which requires root.
* **Sandboxing** Firedancer installs a BPF program to restrict itself
from making certain system calls, and in certain development
environemnts `fdctl` installs network namespaces to simplify network
debugging when using XDP. Performing these initial restrictions can
require additional capabilities.

A good way to see what privileges are needed to configure the
environment is to run `fdctl configure` as a non-privileged user, which
will display information about the operations it wishes to perform.
