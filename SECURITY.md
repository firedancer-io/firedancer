## 3rd Party Security Audits

The Firedancer project engages 3rd party firms to conduct independent security audits of Firedancer.

As these 3rd party audits are completed and issues are sufficiently addressed, we make those audit reports public.

## Audit Contest

We are hosting an [audit contest](https://immunefi.com/boost/firedancer-boost/) for Firedancer v0.1 on Immunefi running from 10 July 2024 to 21 August 2024.
During this time, we reward security reports to the scope defined in the contest rules from a prize pool up to $1M.

# Bug Bounty Program

We are in the process of designing a **bug bounty program** for Firedancer.

In the meantime, if you find a security issue in Firedancer, submit it to the [Audit Contest](#Audit-Contest), or reach out to our team via Discord for security bugs outside the scope of v0.1.
